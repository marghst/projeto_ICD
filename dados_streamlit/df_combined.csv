From Vision to Reality: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Different Urban Planning Phases,Othengrafen F.,Urban Planning,10.17645/up.8576,0,True,Technische Universität Dortmund,Dortmund,Germany,"In an urban context, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can help to categorise and analyse large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. The AI approach can make municipal administration and planning processes more efficient, improve environmental and living conditions (e.g., air quality, inventory of road damages, etc.), or strengthen the participation of residents in decision-making processes. The key to this is “machine learning” that has the ability to recognise patterns, capture models, and learn on the basis of big data via the application of automated statistical methods. However, what does this mean for urban planning and the future development of cities? Will AI take over the planning and design of our cities and actively intervene in and influence planning activities? This article applies a systematic literature review supplemented by case study analyses and expert interviews to categorise various types of AI and relate their potential applications to the different phases of the planning process. The findings emphasize that AI systems are highly specialised applications for solving and processing specific challenges and tasks within a planning process. This can improve planning processes and results, but ultimately AI only suggests alternatives and possible solutions. Thus, AI has to be regarded as a planning tool rather than the planning solution. Ultimately, it is the planners who have to make decisions about the future development of cities, taking into account the possibilities and limitations of the AI applications that have been used in the planning process.","['intelligence', 'models', 'patterns', 'decisions', 'systems', 'large', 'case', 'use', 'recognise', 'decisionmaking', 'systematic', 'solution', 'categorise', 'improve', 'capture', 'various', 'literature', 'analyses', 'relate', 'suggests', 'conditions', 'cities', 'eg', 'amounts', 'administration', 'interviews', 'artificial', 'tool', 'strengthen', 'highly', 'via', 'expert', 'limitations', 'ability', 'processes', 'phases', 'applies', 'road', 'mean', 'basis', 'rather', 'take', 'damages', 'challenges', 'types', 'supplemented', 'possibilities', 'intervene', 'emphasize', 'solutions', 'alternatives', 'actively', 'automated', 'key', 'specific', 'municipal', 'air', 'planners', 'regarded', 'quickly', 'within', 'learning', 'tasks', 'learn', 'activities', 'machine', 'living', 'context', 'influence', 'specialised', 'efficiently', 'applications', 'help', 'review', 'potential', 'taking', 'inventory', 'account', 'environmental', 'solving', 'residents', 'quality', 'different', 'efficient', 'possible', 'analyse', 'future', 'thus', 'processing', 'participation', 'statistical', 'make', 'ultimately', 'etc', 'ai']",2025,"[(1, 0.30249915), (2, 0.26840287), (3, 0.42871872)]"
Revitalizing urban industrial heritage: Enhancing public trust in government through smart city development and open big data analysis using artificial neural network (ANN) modeling,Yue H.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105538,0,False,Sichuan Normal University,Chengdu,China,"This study shows how smart city development revitalizes urban industrial heritage (UIH) and traditional industrial areas, especially by fostering public trust in government through open big data analysis. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to the degradation of many old industrial areas, causing urban decay and environmental concerns. However, smart city technologies show new opportunities for rejuvenating these locations, transforming them into vibrant, sustainable, and livable environments. The research shows challenges faced by UIH, such as outdated infrastructure, pollution, and neglect, and explores how smart city technologies can enhance resource efficiency, mobility, connectivity, and the built environment. It indicates the potential of open big data analysis to foster transparency and accountability, thereby enhancing public trust in government efforts. Various international examples of smart city initiatives illustrate the benefits of these technologies, stressing the importance of community involvement to ensure the success and sustainability of revitalization efforts. Additionally, the study shows an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze relationships among various parameters, showing its effectiveness in understanding complex functions, even with training data errors. By modeling the connections between aging infrastructure, pollution, and factors such as resource use and mobility, the research achieves high predictive accuracy. The study advocates for a holistic approach to urban revitalization that emphasizes social, economic, and environmental sustainability.

The attraction gradient of urban functions: How does functional mix at multiple scales predict urban vitality,Duan J.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105516,0,False,University College London,London,United Kingdom,"What determines urban vitality has been a key research topic for urban planning and management since Jane Jacobs. Recently, statistical examinations of the relationship between the urban environment and vitality have become possible, facilitated by the availability of human positioning big data and fine-grained built environment data. However, existing studies tend to oversimplify the spatial impact of urban environmental factors, focusing solely on immediate surroundings. Due to people's trip chaining and exploration behavior, a place's functions can have a “spill-over” effect across the urban space. This study, therefore, aims to investigate such “attraction gradient” of urban functions to better understand the spatial relationship between urban vitality and its influencing factors. The study uses mobile phone and point-of-interest data from Beijing and Chengdu, China, to model the relationship between a place's vitality and urban functions in different distance bands. We find that, when counting from a place, urban functions within five kilometers significantly predict urban vitality, whereas beyond five kilometers, their contribution is marginal. Daytime and nighttime attraction gradients also differ.

Changes in visitor behaviour across COVID-19 pandemic: Unveiling urban visitation dynamics and non-linear relationships with the built environment using mobile big data,Yuan L.,Habitat International,10.1016/j.habitatint.2024.103216,0,True,The University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"COVID-19 has significantly affected the behavioural patterns of urban visitors. However, the non-linear relationships between visitor behaviour and built environments, particularly how these relationships have evolved during the pandemic, have not yet been extensively studied. Using over 10 million mobile big data records collected over three years in Fukuoka, Japan, incorporating the XGBoost machine learning model and SHAP-PDP interpretation method, we identified non-linear relationships between visitor behaviours and built environments. Our findings uncovered significant non-linear impacts on visitor behaviour of several urban characteristics, such as floor area ratio, building coverage ratio, road density, and POI richness. Notably, the floor area ratio exhibits a negative correlation with visit frequency below 1 but a positive correlation above 2. Building coverage ratio positively impacts visit frequency up to 1000 m2 per 10,000 m2, after which it turns negative; this correlation shifted towards a consistent negative trend during the pandemic. Road density, which usually correlates negatively with visit duration, became positively correlated above 700 m2 per 10,000 m2 during the pandemic. Similarly, the influence of floor area ratio on visit duration reversed from negative to positive under pandemic conditions.

Crafting a jogging-friendly city: Harnessing big data to evaluate the runnability of urban streets,Gao F.,Journal of Transport Geography,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2024.104015,0,False,Collaborative Innovation Center for Natural Resources Planning and Marine Technology of Guangzhou,Guangzhou,China,"Jogging, historically marginalized in the realms of urban and transportation strategy since it is not about commuting, is garnering appreciation for its health-related merits. The growing public focus on health underscores the urgent need for planning and infrastructure to support outdoor physical activities, yet current evaluations of urban environments' friendliness toward such activities are insufficient. This investigation unveils a runnability evaluation framework predicated on accessible geospatial big data. Initial steps involved delineating potential metrics from the built environment, pedestrian perceptions, and the natural setting, as informed by literature. This was followed by constructing a backward stepwise regression analysis, utilizing jogging frequency as the response variable against the identified metrics as predictors. The ensuing model retained certain variables, which were then deemed valid metrics, and their regression coefficients were appropriated as weights to compute a runnability index for individual street segments. This framework was applied in Guangzhou, affirming the model's objectivity and validity. The introduced framework furnishes researchers and urban planners with an objective and reproducible tool for the evaluation of runnability and possesses the versatility for an extension to assess walkability and bikeability.

Spatial equity in healthcare access: An opportunity-utilization perspective,Du F.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105424,0,False,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China,"Spatial equity in healthcare access has long been a key objective of sustainable urban development. However, traditional equity frameworks, while valuable, often fail to fully capture the complexity of actual healthcare utilization, which can lead to the misidentification of service gaps. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that integrates opportunities with actual utilization, making the assessment of spatial equity in healthcare access more reflective of real-world conditions. We apply this framework in Beijing, China, leveraging a comprehensive dataset of health-seeking trips derived from smart card and taxi trajectory records, and identify key factors influencing access through spatial regression models. Our analysis reveals patterns of spatial inequity in healthcare access that diverge significantly from those identified by conventional opportunity-based methods. These inequities are strongly linked to factors such as hospital proximity, socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, and transportation access.

Spatial Quality Optimization Analysis of Streets in Historical Urban Areas Based on Street View Perception and Multisource Data,Xu J.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/JUPDDM.UPENG-4770,1,False,Hefei University of Technology,Hefei,China,"Historic urban areas are unique spaces that carry collective memories and cultural identities, and their spatial quality significantly contributes to urban development and vitality. The sustainable development of these areas is a complex subject that continually garners attention in the field of urban planning. Optimizing their spatial quality necessitates an in-depth understanding of public needs, along with careful consideration of the connection between physical attributes and public perception. Advancements in big data and machine learning have paved the way for the multidimensional evaluation of spatial quality in historic urban areas. In this light, our research proposed a new evaluation system and optimization strategy rooted in the unique attributes and cultural values of these areas. Our empirical research focused on Suzhou Ancient Urban, a representative historic urban area in China. First, we identified six indicators, including appearance, order, atmosphere, and scale, to evaluate the public's perception of the streets in Suzhou Ancient Urban, a place rich with cultural history and local characteristics. This evaluation resulted in a perception map of this area. Second, we explored the unique planning structure, functional distribution, and visual elements of Suzhou Ancient Urban. Using spatial syntax, points of interest (POIs), social media post data processed via natural language processing (SnowNLP), and semantic segmentation methods, we connected the physical attributes of the area with public behavioral preferences and perceptions. This macro-to-micro approach combined subjective and objective evaluations to measure spatial quality. Finally, we established a database for organic urban renewal, which highlights the spatial characteristics of historic urban areas that the public preferred. Our findings indicate that the spaces with higher accessibility in Suzhou Ancient Urban scored better in terms of overall perception. Furthermore, highly distinctive and accessible spaces were the most attractive to the public. Elements such as buildings and walls negatively impacted perception, while infrastructure elements such as roads, pavements, and greenery had a positive effect. This research evaluated the spatial quality of streets in historic urban areas with a special focus on public perception. By combining objective factors such as street accessibility, attractiveness, and visual elements, we discuss the influence of urban structure, function, and components on spatial quality.

Using large-scale high-resolution mobility data sets from millions of aggregated and anonymized mobile phone users in 16 metropolitan counties in the United States, we demonstrate that our embeddings encode complex relationships among features related to urban components (such as distribution of facilities) and population attributes and activities. The clustered representations of urban areas show the shared characteristics among urban areas in the same cluster. We show that embeddings generated by a model trained on a different county can capture 50% to 60% of the spatial structure in another county, allowing us to make cross-county comparisons and inferences. The findings reveal complex relationships among urban components in cities. Since the identified multifaceted spatial structures capture the combined effects of various mechanisms, such as segregation, disparate facility distribution, and human mobility, the findings could help identify the limitations of the current city structure to inform planning decisions and policies. Also, the model and findings set the stage for a variety of research in urban planning, engineering and social science through an integrated understanding of how the complex interactions between urban components and population activities and attributes shape the spatial structures in cities.","['sets', 'decisions', 'social', 'functionally', 'decades', 'heterogeneous', 'modelgraph', 'human', 'structure', 'relationships', 'phenomena', 'set', 'users', 'components', 'various', 'capture', 'states', 'inform', 'cities', 'embedding', 'policies', 'counties', 'millions', 'embeddings', 'cluster', 'united', 'interactions', 'since', 'inferences', 'another', 'complex', 'population', 'anonymized', 'stage', 'sustainability', 'neural', 'limitations', 'could', 'network', 'county', 'allowing', 'engineering', 'disparate', 'areas', 'integrated', 'propose', 'led', 'access', 'emergence', 'encode', 'vector', 'expansion', 'show', 'largescale', 'generated', 'shared', 'representations', 'facility', 'related', 'metropolitan', 'clustered', 'us', 'attributes', 'uncovering', 'built', 'demonstrate', 'obtain', 'crosscounty', 'expanded', 'gnnthat', 'trained', 'activities', 'science', 'identified', 'highresolution', 'diversified', 'effects', 'variety', 'distribution', 'aggregated', 'city', 'sociodemographics', 'mobile', 'phone', 'help', 'leverages', 'mobility', 'combined', 'networks', 'multifaceted', 'features', 'comparisons', 'characteristics', 'critical', 'captured', 'identify', 'facilities', 'different', 'mechanisms', 'current', 'structures', 'equity', 'among', 'shape', 'make', 'environment', 'reveal', 'segregation', 'many']",2024,"[(0, 0.57519084), (1, 0.42386943)]"
Spatial heterogeneities of residents' sentiments and their associations with urban functional areas during heat waves– a case study in Beijing,Zhu Y.,Computational Urban Science,10.1007/s43762-024-00119-z,1,True,Beijing Union University,Beijing,China,"The intensification of global heat wave events is seriously affecting residents' emotional health. Based on social media big data, our research explored the spatial pattern of residents' sentiments during heat waves (SDHW). Besides, their association with urban functional areas (UFAs) was analyzed using the Apriori algorithm of association rule mining. It was found that SDHW in Beijing were characterized by obvious spatial clustering, with hot spots predominately dispersed in urban areas and far suburbs, and cold spots mainly clustered in near suburbs. As for the associations with urban function areas, green space and park areas had significant effects on the positive sentiment in the study area, while a higher percentage of industrial areas had a greater impact on negative SDHW. When it comes to combined UFAs, our results revealed that the green space and park area combined with other functional areas was more closely related to positive SDHW, indicating the significance of promoting positive sentiment. Subdistricts with a lower percentage of residential and traffic areas may have a more negative sentiment. There were two main combined UFAs that have greater impacts on SDHW: the combination of residential and industrial areas, and the combination of residential and public areas.

Promoting their benign development is the key to realizing global sustainable development of urban and rural areas. Planning control is based on precisely defining the spatial extent of suburban areas, and understanding suburban area differentiation and its driving forces scientifically is a key component in raising the bar for focused planning. However, there are currently few research on fine-scale quantitative identification of suburban regions because of their spatial complexity, ambiguous boundaries, and structural dynamic features. Based on this, this paper develops a multi-dimensional identification index system for suburban areas by using multi-source big data and remote sensing information technology, employs the random forest model and the K-Medoids clustering algorithm, identifies the distribution of suburban areas and their subdivided types, analyzes spatial differentiation characteristics, and conducts empirical research using Chengdu City as an example. The findings demonstrate that: (1) The majority of suburban areas in Chengdu City are concentrated in groups or belts surrounding the urban centers of various districts and counties, and the higher the functional class of a district or county, the denser the distribution of suburban areas. (2)The distribution pattern of suburban areas in Chengdu basically conforms to its planned urban hierarchy system.(3)Urban-oriented, suburban-interacted and rural-oriented suburban areas have their own characteristics in land use level, economic development and regional population characteristics.(4)Regional openness, government behavior, social development and geographical location are the core driving factors of spatial differentiation of suburban areas in Chengdu, and the interaction between urban and rural systems, the flow of social resources and the transformation of development models are the spatial mapping dimensions that affect its differentiation.(5)Chengdu can draw up detailed regulatory planning of suburban units to standardize and guide the overall development of suburban areas.

This research uses the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between traffic flows, urban infrastructure, and socio-demographic indicators before, during, and after pandemic periods. We include factors such as road characteristics, socio-demographics, surrounding built environments (land use and nearby points of interest), and the emerging urban big data source of Google Street View images to understand their influences on time series traffic flows. Taking the city of Glasgow as the case study, we have found that areas with more young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows, while natural green spaces are associated with fewer traffic flows. Major roads between cities and towns also show heavier traffic flows. Besides, the application of Google Street View images in this research has revealed the heterogeneous effects of green space on urban traffic flows, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by distance. We also detect that the spatial dependence between adjacent neighbourhoods among the traffic flows and associated urban parameters is variable during the four COVID-19 periods.

In this study, we develop a new approach to assess the degree of freight mobility segregation within cities by leveraging large-scale truck GPS data in Chinese cities. The analysis indicates the existence of freight mobility segregation in cities, where certain groups of trucks serve high-demand areas, while another group of trucks serves low-demand areas. The activity spaces of distinct truck groups are largely non-overlapping or segregated. To uncover the correlations between mobility segregation and truck operational patterns, we introduce two metrics to characterize truck multi-tours behavior, focusing on tour pattern predictability and activity explorability.

The results demonstrate that 1) UTCC performance in these 144 TAZs exhibits a distinct spatial pattern characterised as ‘central region > eastern region > western region’, 2) TAZs in central areas of Chongqing present a “Over-Utilization” UTCC performance level, which is considered that urban policy-makers should take effective measures to alleviate traffic pressure. 3) TAZs with Low-Utilization UTCC performance level are located in the western and eastern regions of Chongqing. Tailor-made policy measures should be designed and implemented in these TAZs to better utilize existing transportation infrastructures. The demonstration confirms that the MHDB model used can provide an effective tool for comparing UTCC performance in different TAZs within a city.","['mhdb', 'developed', 'existing', 'case', 'method', 'booming', 'heterogeneous', 'eastern', 'infrastructures', 'exhibits', 'distinct', 'therefore', 'policymakers', 'lowutilization', 'assess', 'limited', 'traffic', 'measures', 'rapid', 'considered', 'utcc', 'proposed', 'carrying', 'present', 'pressure', 'databased', 'explored', 'congestion', 'located', 'role', 'including', 'across', 'regions', 'tool', 'extensively', 'collected', 'sustainable', 'multisource', 'demonstration', 'effective', 'overutilization', 'tazs', 'provide', 'central', 'utilize', 'chongqing', 'alleviate', 'areas', 'confirms', 'take', 'better', 'types', 'comparing', 'technologies', 'urbanisation', 'transportation', 'demonstrate', 'characterised', 'within', 'light', 'plays', 'incorporating', 'designed', 'crucial', 'point', 'city', 'policy', 'conducted', 'given', 'zones', 'interest', 'nighttime', 'implemented', 'region', 'capacity', 'pattern', 'evaluate', 'different', 'diverse', 'sources', 'western', 'bigdata', 'employed', 'level', 'tailormade']",2024,"[(1, 0.9983721)]"
Decarbonizing megacities: A spatiotemporal analysis considering inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept,Chen W.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105252,0,False,Collaborative Innovation Center for Natural Resources Planning and Marine Technology of Guangzhou,Guangzhou,China,"Megacities are major contributors to global road CO2 emissions, highlighting their pivotal role in achieving low-carbon development. However, comprehensive studies on emission patterns and decarbonization strategies in these metropolitan areas remain limited. This study presents a novel and portable big data-based workflow for megacities to reveal their spatiotemporal dynamics of road CO2 emissions and quantify decarbonization potentials associated with inter-city travel and the 15-minute city concept. We take Guangzhou City (China) as a case study. Our results reveal that primary purpose trips produce 17 % more CO2 emissions than secondary trips on average. Inter-city trips account for 36.3 % of the total emissions in the city, and those for primary purposes exhibit closer spatial distributions with intra-city trips. While providing more 15-minute-walk POIs exhibits a marginally diminishing effect on reducing trip average emissions, comprehensive implementation of the 15-minute city concept in Guangzhou can reduce up to 56.3 % of the total emissions from non-home-related passenger trips, with variations observed across different trip purposes (40 %–70 %). A significant “head effect” of decarbonization potential across communities exists for all trip purposes.

Identifying the spatio-temporal dynamics of mega city region range and hinterland: A perspective of inter-city flows,Hu H.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2024.102146,0,False,Chinese University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"Mega city regions (MCRs) have emerged in many countries in the process of urbanisation. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of MCRs is crucial for sustainable urban development. However, the spatial scales and boundaries of these MCRs remain poorly defined, and their temporal dynamics have received limited attention. To address these gaps, we propose a new framework and GSMA algorithm that considers inter-city flows to identify MCRs' central cities, ranges and hinterlands. By utilising comprehensive data of over 30 million inter-city flow records covering 369 cities from Amap and Tencent, calibrated with official data from the Ministry of Transport, we identify 10 MCRs and 16 central cities in China, providing a clearer understanding of the spatial ranges and core areas of MCRs. We find that MCR ranges show relative stability during routine activities and expansions during holiday periods. Compared with previous methods, the proposed framework and algorithm have two prominent advantages. First, our methodology incorporates the directional characteristics of flows into the identification of MCRs' central cities. Second, we strike a balance between enlarging regional influence and tightening the internal connections in MCR delineation. In addition, by incorporating temporal changes in inter-city flows, the study reveals the temporal dynamics of MCRs which reflects the intricate interplay between human activities and urban system dynamics.","['emerged', 'new', 'delineation', 'mcrs', 'boundaries', 'human', 'clearer', 'million', 'periods', 'incorporates', 'providing', 'limited', 'cities', 'prominent', 'relative', 'received', 'proposed', 'flows', 'core', 'two', 'second', 'temporal', 'remain', 'regions', 'sustainable', 'gsma', 'central', 'find', 'holiday', 'mcr', 'addition', 'areas', 'amap', 'directional', 'ranges', 'propose', 'transport', 'previous', 'official', 'show', 'routine', 'internal', 'records', 'reveals', 'poorly', 'gaps', 'tencent', 'compared', 'urbanisation', 'expansions', 'ministry', 'advantages', 'balance', 'connections', 'identification', 'tightening', 'mega', 'scales', 'covering', 'activities', 'incorporating', 'considers', 'crucial', 'changes', 'influence', 'dynamics', 'city', 'countries', 'attention', 'comprehensive', 'methodology', 'enlarging', 'address', 'flow', 'characteristics', 'intercity', 'calibrated', 'hinterlands', 'first', 'algorithm', 'strike', 'spatiotemporal', 'stability', 'utilising', 'identify', 'intricate', 'system', 'defined', 'reflects', 'regional', 'many', 'interplay']",2024,"[(1, 0.99849534)]"

However, the effectiveness of urban planning strategies in optimizing resource allocation and fostering a vibrant city remains unclear. This study aims to contribute to this understanding by exploring the spatial and temporal effects underlying the association between urban vibrancy and urban forms. Using mobile-phone location-request data along with urban nighttime light data as a proxy for urban vibrancy in Shenzhen, China, we conducted a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) analysis to examine the relationship between land use, street configuration, and urban vibrancy. The results showed that a diverse land use mix and the proportions of land allotted for sports and cultural usage, parks, and greenspace generally have a positive impact on urban vibrancy.

Spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel in China under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic,Wei S.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2024.105206,1,False,Northwest Normal University China,Lanzhou,China,"Investigating the spatiotemporal characteristics of residents' intercity travel affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is of great significance to understanding and extending the impact of major public health affairs on intercity travelers, urban management policies, and intercity cooperative interactions. Taking 366 cities in China as an example, this study proposed a novel research framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity population flows. Using AutoNavi population migration big data sets from web crawling, the spatiotemporal structure patterns of intercity travel in China from January 1st to June 30th, 2020 were extracted by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Then the spatial organization patterns of intercity travel networks in China and its five major urban agglomerations were identified by the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM). The results showed that the total volume of intercity travel in China and its five major urban agglomerations experienced a process of rapid decline followed by a slow recovery, presenting a “V-shaped” distribution since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three distinctive intercity travel patterns, namely the stable, holiday, and weekday-weekend intercity trip patterns, were extracted from the spatiotemporal OD matrix of intercity travel. Strong intercity travels were mainly distributed in eastern and central China, forming an intercity travel pattern in which core cities pushed and pulled each other within the national urban agglomerations. However, intercity migration flows were dominated by weak-intensity flows. Intercity trips during the holidays had a phenomenon of “escaping from the metropolis”. Meanwhile, it had significant spatial proximity and directionality. The daily intercity trips were characterized by a remarkable periodicity with seven days as a repeat. A more interesting finding is that when weekends overlap with holidays, intercity travel on the 1–2 days before the vacations has presented an effect of “suppression travel”. Furthermore, at the national scale, the stable intercity travel network has formed a polycentric core-periphery structure of “Three Cores-Six Semi-peripheries-Five Peripheries”.

Understanding Factors Affecting Tourist Distribution in Urban National Parks Based on Big Data and Machine Learning,Ye Y.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/JUPDDM.UPENG-4772,0,False,Beijing Forestry University,Beijing,China,"Urban national parks (UNPs) provide tourism services in cities worldwide. However, the factors affecting tourist distributions in UNP activity and path spaces remain uncertain. Using Web crawler technology, location big data were tracked and sampled in Donghu National Park in Wuhan, China, and 12 predictor variables were analyzed using a machine-learning method (i.e., random forest). The consistency of the big data compared to the population census and tourist observations was determined at 79.5% and 77.8%, respectively. The tourist number (p) and tourist density (p/ha) per day in the park space in Donghu National Park were 0-2,531 p and 0-198.0 p/ha, respectively. Peak tourist periods showed pressure flows of 0.3-34.5‰ between scenic areas in the park. An analytical framework was formulated for UNPs to link the urban environment, park attributes, and configurational attributes, which here explained 66.4%-72.5% of the tourist distribution in the path and activity spaces. Random forest models performed better than geographically weighted regression (GWR) or ordinary least squares (OLS) models, indicating a complex nonlinear relationship between the independent variables and tourist distribution in UNP spaces, rather than the linear relationship that has previously been found in urban parks. First, both activity and path spaces near developed urban environments or park entrances bore higher tourism pressure. Second, winding routes attracted tourists to path spaces, while water landscapes attracted tourists to both path and activity spaces. Third, tourism pressure in path spaces was determined by configurational attributes.

Research on the Spatial Structure of Xinjiang Port Cities Based on Multi-Source Geographic Big Data—A Case of Central Kashi City,Wang G.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su16166852,0,True,Xinjiang Normal University,Urumqi,China,"Exploring urban spatial structure plays an important role in promoting urban development, but there is a lack of research on the urban spatial structure of Xinjiang ports. This paper takes the central urban area of Kashi City as the study area and integrates points of interest (POI) data with nighttime light (NTL) data using the Open Street Map (OSM) road network to perform kernel density analysis, two-factor combination mapping, and partition identification. It identifies the spatial structural characteristics of the central urban area and divides it into different functional subdivisions. This research shows that ① the overall distributions of nighttime luminance values and POI kernel density are similar, and the overall distribution pattern gradually weakens from the city centre to the surrounding area. High-value areas are distributed in groups, presenting the spatial structure characteristics of one main area and two subareas. ② The fusion of POI data with OSM road network data identifies urban single functional zones and mixed functional zones and divides different functional zones in a more detailed way, with higher accuracy in identifying functional zones. ③ The coupling of POI and nighttime light remote sensing can better characterise the spatial features of the urban structure, such as large-scale homogeneous areas, urban fringe areas, suburbs and township centres, etc. The fusion of POI and the OSM road network can better characterise single and mixed land use types of urban land use and improve the part of the city that cannot be characterised by POI and night light. The results of this study are conducive to the realisation of rational and functional zoning in Kashi City and provide a reference for promoting urban human–land coordination and sustainable development.","['can', 'not', 'mixed', 'points', 'structural', 'use', 'homogeneous', 'structure', 'night', 'open', 'promoting', 'fringe', 'improve', 'map', 'xinjiang', 'zoning', 'similar', 'conducive', 'takes', 'two', 'role', 'identifying', 'integrates', 'fusion', 'township', 'distributions', 'remote', 'sustainable', 'way', 'rational', 'subdivisions', 'part', 'subareas', 'mapping', 'street', 'distributed', 'provide', 'combination', 'highvalue', 'higher', 'central', 'road', 'network', 'reference', 'shows', 'areas', 'partition', 'luminance', 'better', 'types', 'suburbs', 'sensing', 'largescale', 'surrounding', 'important', 'one', 'coordination', 'kernel', 'exploring', 'identification', 'main', 'characterised', 'light', 'detailed', 'weakens', 'plays', 'land', 'overall', 'lack', 'twofactor', 'city', 'distribution', 'groups', 'coupling', 'divides', 'zones', 'kashi', 'interest', 'area', 'realisation', 'single', 'nighttime', 'osm', 'density', 'characterise', 'perform', 'features', 'humanland', 'characteristics', 'functional', 'ports', 'pattern', 'different', 'ntl', 'presenting', 'identifies', 'gradually', 'centres', 'accuracy', 'centre', 'poi', 'values', 'etc']",2024,"[(1, 0.9986558)]"
"Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Leisure Urban Spaces and the Correlation with Population Activity Intensity: A Case Study of Nanjing, China",Li X.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su16167160,0,True,Universiti Putra Malaysia,Serdang,Malaysia,"The spatial distribution of Leisure Urban Spaces (LUSs) is closely linked to urban sustainability and residents’ quality of life. This study uses the Central Urban Area of Nanjing as the study area. Using POI and AOI data, the locations of LUS were precisely identified and categorized, including parks, squares, waterfront spaces, and leisure blocks. GIS spatial analysis methods, the nearest neighbor index, standard deviation ellipse, and kernel density estimation were used to analyze these spaces’ form, directivity, and density. Population activity intensity (PAI) data at various time points, collected by Baidu heat map, are correlated with LUS distribution through multiple linear regression analysis. (1) Parks and squares exhibit significant clustering tendencies, whereas waterfront spaces show weaker clustering, and leisure blocks are randomly distributed; (2) The central points of all types of LUS are located in the city center, extending from southeast to northwest, with parks and squares offering a broader range of services; (3) The overall LUS layout shows a ‘core and multiple points’ structure, with varying density patterns across different spaces, indicating concentrated and dispersed leisure areas; (4) The correlation between LUS distribution and PAI strengthens throughout the day and is greater on weekends than weekdays. Leisure blocks significantly enhance activity intensity, while parks have a limited effect, and waterfront spaces often show a negative correlation due to their remote locations.

"Data-Driven Net-Zero Carbon Monitoring: Applications of Geographic Information Systems, Building Information Modelling, Remote Sensing, and Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable and Resilient Cities",Li J.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su16156285,1,True,UNSW Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"NZCCs aim to minimise urban carbon emissions for healthier cities in line with national and international low-carbon targets and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many countries have recently adopted Net-Zero Carbon City (NZCC) policies and strategies. While there are many studies available on NZCC cities’ definitions and policymaking, currently, research is rare on understanding the role of urban data-driven technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as AI, for achieving the goals of NZCCs in relation to sustainable development goals (SDGs), e.g., SDGs 3, 7,11, 13, and 17. This paper aims to fill this gap by establishing a systematic review and ascertaining the opportunities and barriers of data-driven approaches, analytics, digital technologies, and AI for supporting decision-making and monitoring progress toward achieving NZCC development and policy/strategy development. Two scholarly databases, i.e., Web of Science and Scopus databases, were used to find papers based on our selected relevant keywords. We also conducted a desktop review to explore policies, strategies, and visualisation technologies that are already being used. Our inclusion/exclusion criteria refined our selection to 55 papers, focusing on conceptual and theoretical research. While digital technologies and data analytics are improving and can help in the move from net-zero carbon concepts and theories to practical analysis and the evaluation of cities’ emission levels and in monitoring progress toward reducing carbon, our research shows that these capabilities of digital technologies are not used thoroughly yet to bridge theory and practice. These studies ignore advanced tools like city digital twins and GIS-based spatial analyses. No data, technologies, or platforms are available to track progress towards a NZCC. Artificial Intelligence, big data collection, and analytics are required to predict and monitor the time it takes for each city to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

Spatial heterogeneity and driving mechanisms of carbon emissions in urban expansion areas: A research framework coupled with patterns and functions,Feng X.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107209,5,False,"School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University",Hangzhou,China,"The substantial rise in carbon emissions caused by extensive global urbanization over the past four decades has been one of the key drivers of climate warming. To determine low-carbon and sustainable urban planning strategies, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the multidimensional characteristics of urban expansion and carbon emissions is crucial. Shortcomings, such as limitations on perspectives, methodologies, and spatial scales, remain in current global research. In this study, we proposed an innovative and comprehensive explanatory framework for urban expansion, coupled with patterns and functions, for the first time. Furthermore, this study utilized 338 prefecture-level cities in mainland China, along with multi-source geographic big data, machine-learning models, and Geodetector models, to empirically analyze the spatial heterogeneity and driving mechanisms of carbon emissions in urban expansion areas from 2010 to 2019. China was found to have experienced drastic and spatially unbalanced urban expansion dominated by edge and outlying expansion, with patches of infilling expansion. Regional disparities and differences in urban expansion planning created significant spatial heterogeneity in carbon emissions. Moreover, gross domestic product density had the largest positive effect on carbon emissions in urban expansion areas, while that of vegetation cover, population density, and road density were high during outlying expansion. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed in the magnitude and direction of the influence of each urban functional indicator on carbon emissions during edge expansion. The impacts of public service facilities and residential densities on carbon emissions were enhanced by infilling expansion.

Herein, the spatial composite utilisation is a crucial approach to high-quality urban spatial development. Deconstructing the traditional notion of mixed land use indicates that mixed land development driven by the land market may significantly impact urban spatial composite function (USCF). To assess this effect, we analysed the theoretical mechanisms affecting the USCF in a coupled human-land spatial system. Using 296 town street units in Beijing, China for the spatial analysis of geographic big data, we employed an econometric model to examine the spatial composite functional effects of urban mixed land development (UMLD). The results indicated that the USCF strengthened alongside the maturation of the land market, while the intensity effect of the mixed land development was less pronounced. UMLD significantly promoted the spatial composite function, primarily contingent on the effects within the unit itself. Population density and UMLD exhibited a substitutive relationship in their impact on the USCF, and excessively high population density may attenuate the positive marginal effect of UMLD. Through instrumental variable methods and replacement variable estimations, the results were confirmed as robust.

The results demonstrated that (1) the carrying capacity (carrying area and greenspace type) is the main driving factor for greenspace accessibility; (2) the spatial inequality (Gini coefficient=0.67) in the greenspace accessibility existed at three scales (community > subdistrict > district); (3) the high demand for comprehensive parks by residents leads to general inequalities in greenspace access, while the low supply of community parks causes unequal access to greenspaces for disadvantaged groups; (4) 2SFCA overestimated 85 % of the greenspace recreation carrying area, leading to a significant overestimation of the community park accessibility and disadvantaged groups’ accessibility to greenspaces; (5) the 3SFCA revealed that the visitor number (2,993 p) exceeded the carrying capacity (2,987 p) of greenspaces, and community parks faces interference from recreational usage.

Within the purview of a conceptual framework that interlinks social strata and citizenship identity with environmental inequality, this study examines the environmental inequality of PM2.5 exposure with a focus on the city of Xi’an. Quantitative metrics of the social strata and citizenship identities of the ambient population are derived from housing price data and mobile phone big data. The fine-scale estimation of PM2.5 concentrations is predicated on the kriging interpolation method and refined by leveraging an advanced dataset. Employing geographically weighted regression models, we examine the environmental inequality pattern at a fine spatial scale. The key findings are threefold: (1) the manifestation of environmental inequality in PM2.5 exposure is pronounced among individuals of varying social strata and citizenship identities within our study area, Xi’an; (2) nonlocal residents situated in the northwestern precincts of Xi’an are subject to the most pronounced PM2.5 exposure; and (3) an elevated socioeconomic status is identified as an attenuating factor, capable of averting the deleterious impacts of PM2.5 exposure among nonlocal residents.

Spatial heterogeneity of the impact of built environment on urban vitality: A case study of the central urban area of Nanjing,Sun H.,Dili Yanjiu,10.11821/dlyj020230911,1,False,Suzhou University of Science and Technology,Suzhou,China,"Urban vitality largely reflects the quality of life of urban residents and the high-quality level of urban development, and has always been a hot topic in urban geography and urban planning. In the transition period of urban development from incremental extension to stock connotation renewal, accurately identifying the spatial pattern of urban vitality under a people- oriented approach and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of built environment on it is a key prerequisite for scientifically enhancing urban vitality. Therefore, this paper attempts to take the central urban area of Nanjing as an example, based on geographic big data such as mobile signaling data and Baidu Map POI, and integrating the spatio-temporal attributes of daily activities of citizens as parameters to construct a measurement model of urban vitality, and analyze its spatial characteristics at the urban scale. On this basis, we expand the representation of ""5D"" built environment elements, construct an urban built environment impact indicator system that includes material space, social space, place space, and flow space elements, and use a multi-scale geographically weighted regression model (MGWR) to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of built environment on urban vitality.

"The impact of urban configuration types on urban heat islands, air pollution, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and mortality in Europe: a data science approach",Iungman T.,The Lancet Planetary Health,10.1016/S2542-5196(24)00120-7,6,True,Instituto de Salud Global de Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain,"Background: The world is becoming increasingly urbanised. As cities around the world continue to grow, it is important for urban planners and policy makers to understand how different urban configuration patterns affect the environment and human health. However, previous studies have provided mixed findings. We aimed to identify European urban configuration types, on the basis of the local climate zones categories and street design variables from Open Street Map, and evaluate their association with motorised traffic flows, surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensities, tropospheric NO2, CO2 per person emissions, and age-standardised mortality. Methods: We considered 946 European cities from 31 countries for the analysis defined in the 2018 Urban Audit database, of which 919 European cities were analysed. Data were collected at a 250 m × 250 m grid cell resolution. We divided all cities into five concentric rings based on the Burgess concentric urban planning model and calculated the mean values of all variables for each ring. First, to identify distinct urban configuration types, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction method, followed by the k-means clustering algorithm. Next, statistical differences in exposures (including SUHI) and mortality between the resulting urban configuration types were evaluated using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test. Findings: We identified four distinct urban configuration types characterising European cities: compact high density (n=246), open low-rise medium density (n=245), open low-rise low density (n=261), and green low density (n=167). Compact high density cities were a small size, had high population densities, and a low availability of natural areas. In contrast, green low density cities were a large size, had low population densities, and a high availability of natural areas and cycleways. The open low-rise medium and low density cities were a small to medium size with medium to low population densities and low to moderate availability of green areas. Motorised traffic flows and NO2 exposure were significantly higher in compact high density and open low-rise medium density cities when compared with green low density and open low-rise low density cities. Additionally, green low density cities had a significantly lower SUHI effect compared with all other urban configuration types. Per person CO2 emissions were significantly lower in compact high density cities compared with green low density cities. Lastly, green low density cities had significantly lower mortality rates when compared with all other urban configuration types. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that, although the compact city model is more sustainable, European compact cities still face challenges related to poor environmental quality and health. Our results have notable implications for urban and transport planning policies in Europe and contribute to the ongoing discussion on which city models can bring the greatest benefits for the environment, climate, and health.

These refer to mobility conditions, infrastructure, land use, wider socio-economic factors, energy use and environmental and climate effects. AVs may affect all these in positive or negative ways, promoting or obstructing the promotion of specific aspects of sustainable urban development. An integrated planning framework is needed to maximise the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones. The main obstacle in the process of developing such a framework is the absence of empirical data and experience from the implementation of this emerging technology. This chapter outlines the possible impacts of AVs and discusses their uncertainty and trade-offs in relation to sustainable urban development. The categorisation of impacts derives from the priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The chapter also highlights the lack of data for the development of an evidence-based planning approach and suggests relevant recommendations to planners. In contrast to the current lack of data, the future abundance of Big Data collected by autonomous road transport systems is discussed in the context of future urban planning purposes.

Where Are Business Incubators Built? County-Level Spatial Distribution and Rationales Based on the Big Data of Chinese Yangtze River Delta Region,Jiang T.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi13060169,0,True,Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications,Nanjing,China,"Business incubators (BIs) in China have predominantly exhibited a government-led characteristic, recently broadening their spatial and temporal scope and extending reach to the county level. Regarding the inadequacies of county-level analysis scale, this study leverages Points of Interest (POI) big data to overcome them. To comprehend the governmental rationale in the construction of BIs, we examine the evolution dynamics of BIs in conjunction with policies. An economic geography framework is developed, conceptualizing BIs as quasi-public goods and productive services, and incorporating considerations of county-level fiscal operations and industrial structures. Focusing on the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region as a case study, our findings reveal that over 98% of County Administrative Units (CAUs) have built BIs. Using kernel density estimation and Moran’s I, the spatial patterns of CAUs are identified. The CAUs are further classified into three categories of economic levels using the k-means algorithm, uncovering differentiated relationships between industry, finance, and their respective BI. Additionally, we analyze the density relationship between BIs and other facilities at a micro-level, showcasing various site selection rationales. The discussions highlight that while BIs tend to align with wealthier areas and advanced industries, affluent CAUs offer location advantages on BIs, whereas less wealthy CAUs prioritize quantity for political achievements.

Integration of Smart City Technologies with Advanced Predictive Analytics for Geotechnical Investigations,Cong Y.,Smart Cities,10.3390/smartcities7030046,6,True,Shibaura Institute of Technology,Tokyo,Japan,"Highlights: What are the main findings? Ensemble learning methods proved superior in accurately predicting the depth of bearing layers critical to urban infrastructure, improving geotechnical predictions and urban planning. The integration of smart technologies and predictive analytics significantly improved the accuracy of geotechnical investigations, facilitating the development of smart cities by providing advanced tools for real-time data analysis and geographic mapping. What are the implications of the main finding? The success of ensemble learning in accurately predicting the depth of bearing layers can lead to more reliable urban planning and infrastructure development, reducing the risks associated with building on unstable ground. By using advanced predictive analytics, smart city technologies can significantly improve the resilience and sustainability of urban environments, leading to better preparedness for environmental challenges and disasters. This paper addresses challenges and solutions in urban development and infrastructure resilience, particularly in the context of Japan’s rapidly urbanizing landscape. It explores the integration of smart city concepts to combat land subsidence and liquefaction, phenomena highlighted by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Additionally, it examines the current situation and lack of geoinformation and communication technology in the concept of smart cities in Japan. Consequently, this study employs advanced technologies, including smart sensing and predictive analytics through kriging and ensemble learning, with the objective of enhancing the precision of geotechnical investigations and urban planning. By analyzing data in Setagaya, Tokyo, it develops predictive models to accurately determine the depth of bearing layers that are critical to urban infrastructure. The results demonstrate the superiority of ensemble learning in predicting the depth of bearing layers. Two methods have been developed to predict undetected geographic data and prepare ground reality and digital smart maps for the construction industry to build smart cities. This study is useful for real-time analysis of existing data, for the government to make new urban plans, for construction companies to conduct risk assessments before doing their jobs, and for individuals to obtain real-time geographic data and hazard warnings through mobile phones and other means in the future.

However, evidence for the growth of ‘micro-apartments’ is mixed, with existing data making it difficult to map the geographies of sub-standard homes below the Local Authority scale. Focussing on London, this paper uses Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) as a source of floorspace data, matching this to the Land Registry’s Price Paid Data (PPD) and information from the London Planning Database. It quantifies the number of sub-standard homes in London registered for an EPC 2010–21, maps their location at the MSOA (neighbourhood) level, and compares property prices for small and larger homes. Focusing on newly-built homes, it shows that the numbers of small homes doubled across this period with growth in select outer London ‘hotspots’ accounting for much of this. It also demonstrates the overall numbers of small homes rose despite the formal incorporation of NDSS in the London Plan 2016, with the by-passing of space standards in property conversions under Permitted Development Rights, 2013–21 appearing relatively insignificant in explaining these temporal and spatial trends. Finally, it shows that the price per square metre of small homes often far exceeds that of much larger homes in the same area.

Towards a multi-database CityGML environment adapted to big geodata issues of urban digital twins,Kasprzyk J.P.,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W10-2024-101-2024,0,True,Université de Liège,Liege,Belgium,"This paper investigates the challenges of implementing the CityGML standard within database environments for managing urban digital twins (UDT), with a particular focus on addressing big geodata issues. CityGML stands as a critical standard for representing and exchanging 3D urban models and thematic data, essential for effective urban planning and infrastructure management. However, integrating CityGML into databases poses challenges due to the dual requirements of geospatial and semi-structured data. While the former imposes a certain rigor in its formalism, the second benefits from more flexibility. Through a comprehensive review and benchmarking of existing database implementations, including both new distributions and those often use, 3DCityDB, CJDB, Measur3D, and Cerbere, this paper proposes a novel approach towards a multi-database CityGML environment tailored to the specific needs of UDT. The proposed solution leverages the strengths of both relational and NoSQL databases, offering a flexible and scalable architecture while ensuring data consistency, geospatial capabilities and compliance with the CityGML schema. The research hypothesis suggests integrating Cerbere, a middleware for CityGML schema compliance and transaction validation, with 3DCityDB and Measur3D (MongoDB). This approach aims to demonstrate the feasibility of managing advanced 3D data operations based on the CityGML model (3DCityDB) and scalability for big data like IoT (Measur3D) within a multi-database environment. The paper contributes to the advancement of UDT by providing a comprehensive solution for managing diverse data types, facilitating more effective urban planning, infrastructure management, and sustainable development initiatives in the context of smart cities.","['models', 'management', 'new', 'rigor', 'existing', 'use', 'multidatabase', 'aims', 'implementations', 'solution', 'essential', 'providing', 'geodata', 'suggests', 'smart', 'capabilities', 'cities', 'proposed', 'feasibility', 'managing', 'second', 'representing', 'dual', 'including', 'distributions', 'hypothesis', 'middleware', 'geospatial', 'sustainable', 'stands', 'initiatives', 'effective', 'flexibility', 'udt', 'towards', 'due', 'cerbere', 'schema', 'strengths', 'flexible', 'contributes', 'novel', 'nosql', 'compliance', 'scalable', 'challenges', 'benefits', 'types', 'thematic', 'facilitating', 'digital', 'relational', 'citygml', 'scalability', 'advanced', 'specific', 'semistructured', 'demonstrate', 'ensuring', 'tailored', 'within', 'proposes', 'needs', 'consistency', 'transaction', 'particular', 'database', 'exchanging', 'context', 'certain', 'like', 'infrastructure', 'benchmarking', 'standard', 'comprehensive', 'review', 'leverages', 'former', 'formalism', 'environments', 'operations', 'issues', 'architecture', 'imposes', 'offering', 'critical', 'addressing', 'focus', 'iot', 'databases', 'implementing', 'requirements', 'diverse', 'twins', 'investigates', 'integrating', 'cjdb', 'validation', 'advancement', 'environment', 'poses', 'often', 'mongodb']",2024,"[(3, 0.9982973)]"
Designing data dramas to build empathy to nature through collective acts,Wolff A.,"Designing More-than-Human Smart Cities: Beyond Sustainability, Towards Cohabitation",10.1093/9780191980060.003.0010,0,False,,,,"Environmental data may play a part in urban planning, especially to evidence negative impacts of proposed development on nature. However, its utility is only as good as people's capability and willingness to make sense of it.

In this chapter we explore data drama as an active and collective way for embodying and understanding data. We locate this arts-based genre in relation to the fields of applied drama and theatre and drama education, critical pedagogy, arts-based research, and data science. The imagination, emotions, and feelings are as central to the arts as cognition and rationality are to data science.

Mining Multimodal Travel Mobilities with Big Ridership Data: Comparative Analysis of Subways and Taxis,Zhang H.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su16104305,0,True,Shandong Jianzhu University,Jinan,China,"Understanding traveler mobility in cities is significant for urban planning and traffic management. However, most traditional studies have focused on travel mobility in a single traffic mode. Only limited studies have focused on the travel mobility associated with multimodal transportation. Subways are considered a green travel mode with large capacity, while taxis are an energy-consuming travel mode that provides a personalized service. Exploring the relationship between subway mobility and taxi mobility is conducive to building a sustainable multimodal transportation system, such as one with mobility as a service (MaaS). In this study, we propose a framework for comparatively analyzing the travel mobilities associated with subways and taxis. Firstly, we divided taxi trips into three groups: competitive, cooperative, and complementary. Voronoi diagrams based on subway stations were introduced to divide regions. An entropy index was adopted to measure the mix of taxi trips. Secondly, subway and taxi trip networks were constructed based on the divided regions. The framework was tested based on the automatic fare collection (AFC) data and global positioning system (GPS) data of a subway in Beijing, China. The results showed that the proportions of taxi competition, taxi cooperation, and taxi complements were 9.1%, 35.6%, and 55.3%, respectively. The entropy was large in the central city and small in the suburbs. Moreover, it was found that the subway trip network was connected more closely than the taxi network. However, the unbalanced condition of taxis is more serious than that of the subway.","['adopted', 'green', 'management', 'diagrams', 'subways', 'large', 'tested', 'relationship', 'taxis', 'associated', 'global', 'limited', 'traffic', 'positioning', 'complements', 'closely', 'considered', 'cities', 'proportions', 'condition', 'traditional', 'service', 'mix', 'mode', 'cooperation', 'conducive', 'fare', 'automatic', 'subway', 'multimodal', 'regions', 'sustainable', 'three', 'beijing', 'significant', 'secondly', 'energyconsuming', 'found', 'respectively', 'central', 'network', 'showed', 'stations', 'comparatively', 'measure', 'propose', 'collection', 'provides', 'maas', 'index', 'traveler', 'suburbs', 'trips', 'personalized', 'voronoi', 'one', 'studies', 'entropy', 'cooperative', 'constructed', 'competitive', 'transportation', 'taxi', 'exploring', 'serious', 'travel', 'introduced', 'small', 'complementary', 'city', 'groups', 'competition', 'firstly', 'focused', 'mobility', 'single', 'networks', 'gps', 'connected', 'trip', 'divided', 'building', 'analyzing', 'capacity', 'unbalanced', 'mobilities', 'system', 'divide', 'moreover', 'afc']",2024,"[(1, 0.8615457), (2, 0.13745674)]"
Is There a Digital Rebound in the Process of Urban Green Development? New Empirical Evidence Using Ensemble Learning Methods,Ping Y.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su16104281,0,True,Shanghai Ocean University,Shanghai,China,"The convergence of digitization and greening is an unavoidable path of modern economic progress. Nonetheless, the digital economy does not consistently align with the principles of green development, potentially leading to a rebound effect in urban digitalization initiatives. To investigate the correlation between the digital rebound effect and urban green development, this study utilizes panel data from Chinese prefecture-level cities spanning from 2011 to 2019. By examining the dual impact of the digital economy on green development, the paper posits a theoretical hypothesis regarding the nonlinear marginal effect of the digital economy. This research demonstrates an inverted U-shaped correlation between the digital economy and urban green development via empirical analyses employing the random forest algorithm and partial dependency plots. It supports the existence of a moderate digital resiliency effect, which eventually reaches a state of stability rather than greatly diminishing the degree of green development in urban areas. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive effects of the digital economy are more popular in cities located in the eastern and central regions, as well as in the National Comprehensive Pilot Zone for Big Data. However, these effects do not vary significantly among different ranks of cities. The mechanism test found that the information effect and the capital allocation effect are the mechanisms by which the digital economy affects green development, and there is a “U-shaped” relationship between the digital economy and information asymmetry and capital mismatch.

"A Multi-Feature Fusion Method for Urban Functional Regions Identification: A Case Study of Xi’an, China",Wang Z.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi13050156,1,True,Shaanxi Normal University,Xi'an,China,"Research on the identification of urban functional regions is of great significance for the understanding of urban structure, spatial planning, resource allocation, and promoting sustainable urban development. However, achieving high-precision urban functional region recognition has always been a research challenge in this field. For this purpose, this paper proposes an urban functional region identification method called ASOE (activity–scene–object–economy), which integrates the features from multi-source data to perceive the spatial differentiation of urban human and geographic elements. First, we utilize VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16) to extract high-level semantic features from the remote sensing images with 1.2 m spatial resolution. Then, using scraped building footprints, we extract building object features such as area, perimeter, and structural ratios. Socioeconomic features and population activity features are extracted from Point of Interest (POI) and Weibo data, respectively. Finally, integrating the aforementioned features and using the Random Forest method for classification, the identification results of urban functional regions in the main urban area of Xi’an are obtained. After comparing with the actual land use map, our method achieves an identification accuracy of 91.74%, which is higher than other comparative methods, making it effectively identify four typical urban functional regions in the main urban area of Xi’an (e.g., residential regions, industrial regions, commercial regions, and public regions).

Identification of Spatial Association Network Characteristics and Influencing Factors of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Based on Online Car-Hailing Data,Shuang M.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003873,0,False,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"Urban agglomerations are the main spatial carriers of national and regional urbanization development. The study of their spatial association networks is of great significance for optimizing the allocation of urban resources, promoting the process of regional integration, and facilitating the high-quality development of urban agglomerations. The Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) is one of the most economically active regions in China. Its spatial association network structure was the main feature of economic and social development in China's ""14th Five-Year Plan."" Based on the perspective of flow spaces in terms of both the city and township scales, multi-source data were used in this study and included online car-hailing origin-destination travel data, combined with complex network models and a quadratic assignment procedure, to analyze the structural characteristics and driving mechanism of the spatial association network of the YRDUA. Results show that: 1) spatial association network based on online car-hailing flow in the YRDUA has spatial dependence and hierarchical characteristics, and intensities of network association are mostly coupled with levels of economic development; 2) spatial association network in the YRDUA displays spatial spillover effects, leading to an overall pattern of high equilibrium in southern development and strong single-point development capacity in the north; 3) the structural features of spatial association network in the YRDUA differ between townships and urban scales, with some high-level townships in certain transportation networks failing to exert their driving role at the urban level; and 4) economic development status, population vitality, the level of urban construction, and administrative division ownership and geographical location differences between townships have significant impacts on the spatial association network structure in terms of the township scale. The differences in administrative divisions are most important. Online car-hailing travel data were used in this study to effectively supplement the links between township streets within and between cities. This data also revealed intercity links. Thus, the development characteristics of spatial units on different scales were reflected, and research and social management needs were satisfied on a fine scale. In addition, by introducing spatial big data and analyzing the influence mechanism from various aspects, such as socioeconomics, the driving factors of the spatial network of urban agglomerations were systematically identified at the small-scale level, which will help with more reasonable planning within the city and play a role in the development of urban agglomerations by enhancing the attractiveness of individual cities.

To address this knowledge gap, this study introduces a novel method for assessing vitality through the lens of human mobility. By combining residents' origin-destination (OD) flow data with the PageRank algorithm, our approach evaluates regional vitality by considering visitation volume, travel distance, and the architecture of the flow network simultaneously. Focusing on Shenzhen, China, as a case study, we evaluate its urban vitality from 2019 to 2023 using the OD flows extracted from mobile phone big data. Building on this evaluation, a resilience indicator is further established to measure the recovery of vitality, and the geographically weighted regression is employed to investigate the factors influencing vitality, with their spatial and temporal changes being explored. Our findings reveal that, as of June 2023, the overall urban vitality in Shenzhen has only recovered to 86% of the level during the same period in 2019, with certain districts exhibiting a continuous decline in vitality even as the epidemic subsided.

City evaluation methodology: An overview,Liu H.,Dili Yanjiu,10.11821/dlyj020230628,2,False,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Beijing,China,"Cities serve as pivotal symbols of human civilization, and evaluating their development and decline is crucial for urban planning, construction, and governance. Such evaluations carry substantial implications for local government performance assessments, corporate investments, and residents' settlements. However, current research on city evaluation faces several challenges, including ambiguous evaluation purposes and target audiences, a lack of a solid theoretical or practical foundation for index systems, high redundancy in indices, poor comparability, disregard for urban diversity, an excessive focus on city rankings, and a dearth of result validation and feedback mechanisms. There is also a shortage of systematic interpretation regarding the composition, principles, paradigms, process, and uncertainties associated with urban evaluation systems. In this paper, we commence by scrutinizing the structural interconnections and evolution of urban systems through the lens of complex systems and living organisms. Subsequently, we elucidate the fundamental concepts, components, and functions of city evaluation, categorize the key paradigms, and propose four basic principles: people- centric, emergence, balance, and feedback- driven. We posit that the city evaluation system comprises five essential elements: the evaluating subject, the evaluated object, the index framework, evaluation methods, and the evaluation findings. We provide a comprehensive exploration of the general quantitative city evaluation process, encompassing ten distinct phases. These phases include clarifying the subject/object and the evaluation goals, establishing the theoretical underpinning and logical framework, outlining the criteria for indicator selection, establishing the evaluation index system, ensuring the consistency and dimensionless of the indicators, determining the weightings and thresholds of the indicators, selecting or constructing the evaluation model, analyzing and validating the evaluation outcomes, displaying and applying the results, and overseeing and incorporating feedback into the evaluation. The uncertainty and limitations of city evaluation are sorted from the aspects of cognition, data, indicators, methods, and systems. Furthermore, we envision the future of city evaluation for sustainable development, emphasizing the need to assemble a diverse group of evaluation stakeholders, develop a unified and shared foundational information platform, create a city space- time knowledge map, harness emerging technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and digital twinning, promote ""dynamic perception, multi- evaluation collaboration"" and forge a future city that embodies inclusivity, safety, fairness, environmental sustainability, and resilience.","['intelligence', 'several', 'systems', 'practical', 'audiences', 'structural', 'redundancy', 'evolution', 'perception', 'result', 'high', 'ambiguous', 'human', 'systematic', 'faces', 'theoretical', 'essential', 'components', 'time', 'five', 'distinct', 'associated', 'lens', 'evaluating', 'map', 'dearth', 'implications', 'goals', 'fairness', 'regarding', 'determining', 'cities', 'symbols', 'unified', 'indicator', 'organisms', 'outcomes', 'serve', 'commence', 'elements', 'centric', 'including', 'subsequently', 'excessive', 'scrutinizing', 'driven', 'quantitative', 'artificial', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'concepts', 'disregard', 'forge', 'selection', 'group', 'sustainability', 'uncertainty', 'aspects', 'four', 'criteria', 'assessments', 'cognition', 'fundamental', 'collaboration', 'interpretation', 'dynamic', 'need', 'provide', 'limitations', 'phases', 'general', 'exploration', 'thresholds', 'overseeing', 'solid', 'space', 'civilization', 'propose', 'validating', 'include', 'rankings', 'emergence', 'challenges', 'index', 'weightings', 'paradigms', 'underpinning', 'resilience', 'decline', 'digital', 'shared', 'embodies', 'dimensionless', 'technologies', 'diversity', 'principles', 'indicators', 'carry', 'shortage', 'foundational', 'categorize', 'subjectobject', 'interconnections', 'evaluations', 'local', 'indices', 'key', 'feedback', 'displaying', 'balance', 'corporate', 'ensuring', 'constructing', 'create', 'outlining', 'ten', 'emerging', 'applying', 'logical', 'posit', 'people', 'substantial', 'establishing', 'incorporating', 'consistency', 'lack', 'pivotal', 'settlements', 'crucial', 'living', 'multi', 'develop', 'uncertainties', 'government', 'envision', 'city', 'governance', 'platform', 'comprehensive', 'encompassing', 'furthermore', 'purposes', 'object', 'selecting', 'emphasizing', 'construction', 'target', 'functions', 'environmental', 'comparability', 'stakeholders', 'subject', 'sorted', 'basic', 'investments', 'analyzing', 'focus', 'residents', 'assemble', 'twinning', 'mechanisms', 'inclusivity', 'diverse', 'elucidate', 'current', 'future', 'clarifying', 'composition', 'system', 'evaluated', 'validation', 'poor', 'foundation', 'safety', 'promote', 'comprises', 'harness']",2024,"[(2, 0.9989796)]"

Knowing what people do and where they build social relationships gives insights into the distribution and availability of places for social functions. We developed a Bayesian Network model, integrating points of interest (POIs) and sociodemographic characteristics, to estimate the probabilistic effects of places and people on the presence of social events. A case study in Dallas demonstrated the utility and performance of the model. The Bayesian Network model predicted the presence likelihoods for seven types of social events with an R2 value around 0.83 (95% confidence interval). For both the presence and absence of social events at locations, the model predictions were within a 20% error for most event types. Furthermore, the model suggested POI, age, education, and population density configurations as important contextual variables for place–event associations across locations. A spatial cluster analysis identified likely multifunctional hotspots for social events (i.e., socially vibrant places).

In other words, a city is more likely to develop its own industrial comparative advantage in the specialized field of another city that has a strong knowledge correlation with it. 3) There is asignificant knowledge network correlation in the evolution of the industrial comparative advantage structure of cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The stronger the knowledge flows, the higher the similarity of industrial comparative advantage structure between cities. To some extent, this study deepens the understanding of the knowledge dynamics and multi-scale related variety of the evolution of industrial comparative advantages in the digital economy era and helps to provide a theoretical basis for regional innovation and industrial upgrading policies.","['delta', 'evolution', 'common', 'high', 'controlling', 'analyze', 'structure', 'theoretical', 'therefore', 'river', 'rapid', 'newgeneration', 'rail', 'capabilities', 'cities', 'cross', 'likely', 'correlation', 'flows', 'policies', 'similarity', 'logit', 'role', 'specialized', 'another', 'helps', 'significant', 'increasingly', 'manufacturing', 'technology', 'evolutionary', 'provide', 'found', 'becoming', 'economic', 'higher', 'influenced', 'network', 'basis', 'output', 'variables', 'comparative', 'geography', 'premise', 'awhole', 'strong', 'interaction', 'value', 'industries', 'digital', 'asignificant', 'emphasize', 'related', 'studies', 'yangtze', 'local', 'advantageous', 'speed', 'extent', 'advantages', 'significantly', 'citation', 'path', 'era', 'advantage', 'industry', 'close', 'patent', 'crucial', 'total', 'develop', 'variety', 'infrastructure', 'dynamics', 'city', 'deepens', 'dependence', 'flow', 'economy', 'industrial', 'intercity', 'innovation', 'words', 'field', 'diverse', 'mechanism', 'statistical', 'stronger', 'multiscale', 'upgrading', 'regional', 'many']",2024,"[(1, 0.5200715), (2, 0.47895312)]"

This paper argues that some important processes in shaping vitality may be overlooked without examining the intensity and diversity of economic and human activities. Using newly developed spatial big data and adopting the methods of multi-indicator measurement and spatial analysis methods, we analyzed the pattern of urban vitality in Chongqing, a provincial city in western China and, on this basis, evaluated the creation and maintenance of urban vitality from the economic and human activities perspective. Our findings indicate that the impacts of economic and human activities are positive and significant. Among the three intensity and diversity indicators, economic intensity and population density show an effect on urban vitality stronger than that of economic diversity. However, economic diversity has the strongest superposition or interactive effect, and is thus an important foundation dynamic. The positive effect of population density on urban vitality is largely a result of Chongqing’s jobs-housing balance. The case of Chongqing highlights the importance of topographic features, historical inheritance, large-scale migration, and cultural activities in shaping the distinctive vitality pattern of a city.

Examining spatial coordination of human-land-industry-service system from a regionalization approach: A case study of Beijing,Wang Y.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.107010,1,False,"Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science, Ministry of Education",Shanghai,China,"Sustainable development requires a better understanding of the coupling relationship among population, urban land use, industry, and city services since they are closely related to the benefits of human beings.

ADC-CPANet：A remote sensing image classification method based on local-global feature fusion,Wang W.,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,10.11834/jrs.20232658,0,True,Changsha University of Science and Technology,Changsha,China,"The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, has led to a surge in the amount and types of high-resolution remote sensing images. This advancement marks the onset of the“era of remote sensing big data.” Compared with low-resolution ones, high-resolution remote sensing images provide richer texture, detailed information, and a more complex structure, making them crucial for applications like urban planning. However, images within the same category can vary substantially, whereas images from different categories may appear similar. Therefore, multi-scale feature extraction is important for remote sensing image scene classification. Current methods for remote sensing image scene classification can be divided into two categories according to the feature representation: those based on manual design features and those based on deep learning. Those based manual design features cover scale-invariant feature transformation and gradient scale histogram. They can achieve good results for simple classification tasks, but the feature information they extract may be incomplete or redundant, so the accuracy of classification in complex scenes remains low. By contrast, the methods based on deep learning have made incredible progress in scene classification owing to their powerful feature extraction ability. Compared with traditional methods, Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used in visual tasks, particularly those that involve more complex connections and diverse convolution forms. CNNs are effective at extracting local features, but they struggle with capturing long-distance dependencies among features. The Transformer architecture, which has recently been applied to computer vision, addresses this limitation through its self-attention layer that enables global feature extraction. Recent studies show that hybrid architectures combining CNNs and Transformers can utilize their advantages. This study proposes an Aggregation Depth-wise Convolution (ADC) module and a Convolution Parallel Attention (CPA) module. The ADC module effectively extracts local feature information and enhances the robustness of the model to image flipping and rotation. The CPA module integrates global and local feature extraction, with a multi-group convolution head decomposition designed to expand the receptive field and enhance feature extraction capacity. A remote sensing image scene classification model called ADC-CPANet is designed on the basis of two modules. The ADC and CPA modules are stacked at each stage of the model, improving its ability to extract global and local features. The effectiveness of ADC-CPANet is validated using the RSSCN7 and Google Image datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ADC-CPANet achieves classification accuracies of 96.43% on the RSSCN7 dataset and 96.04% on the Google Image dataset, outperforming other advanced models.

The term smart city, which includes related issues such as smart well-being, smart transit, and smart society, has attracted considerable attention in the academia and policymaking due to its impact on people’s quality of life. The development of various models like forecast, preparation, and monitoring in smart cities has been enhanced by deep learning and machine learning techniques for urban development. In self-driving cars, traffic lights and traffic control systems, systems to support the management of energy distribution, and water-in sum, wherever there will be large masses of information to be managed-there is an opportunity to develop algorithms to handle it. Although presented as objective tools, algorithms are to be regarded as sociotechnical devices that incorporate the perspectives of the authors involved in their creation. Thus, mentioning “algorithmic risk” is important to highlight the potentially harmful consequences-intentional or unintentional-that algorithms can generate for individuals and societies in smart cities. The objective of this chapter is to examine a possible hypothetical “geo-discrimination risk”, an issue that might transform smart cities in places where opportunities and possibilities are not evenly distributed. The findings of this research suggest that the unquestioning integration of algorithms in the urban development of smart cities has the potential to affect both the physical urban environment and the lives of individuals, leading to the emergence of geo-discrimination at both these distinct levels.

Mixed-use urban land parcels identification integrating geospatial data and machine learning,Qu S.,Geo-Spatial Information Science,10.1080/10095020.2024.2374996,0,True,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,Beijing,China,"Urban land use information is essential for urban planning and sustainable development. However, the increasing prevalence of Mixed-Use Urban Land (MUUL) introduces uncertainty in land use mapping. Due to the compatibility of different human activities within MUUL, identifying MUUL is still a challenge for scholars. In this study, we proposed a novel framework by integrating geographic big data and machine learning to identify it. First, to be consistent with urban planning practices, we delineated mapping units from urban planning map. Second, based on the variability of the spatial pattern of POIs, two indices, the Amount of POI (AP) and the Deviation Index (DI), were developed. Finally, the random forest model was employed. The empirical study in the Jianghan District of Wuhan, China, showed that the MUUL and non-MUUL exhibited significant spatial pattern of POIs separability, the average AP and DI of the MUUL were much larger than those of the non-MUUL. Moreover, the relatively high identification accuracy (Kappa Coefficient (KC) = 0.85, Hellden’s Mean Accuracy (MA) = 0.87) further demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed indices. The proposed framework in this study can reduce the adverse impacts of MUUL on urban land identification by avoiding the MUUL from being incorrectly identified as a single function. Moreover, by extracting MUUL in advance, it can improve the research efficiency by avoiding the application of the segmentation algorithm to all mapping units as in the previous study. Overall, this study provides important references for scholars to increase the accuracy of urban land use identification and allows authorities and policymakers to monitor the dynamics of MUUL that are essential to urban vibrancy. The spatial pattern indices proposed in this study can also be applied to urban land use identification studies as important features.","['developed', 'use', 'applied', 'high', 'district', 'human', 'essential', 'improve', 'map', 'efficiency', 'policymakers', 'reduce', 'incorrectly', 'finally', 'proposed', 'compatibility', 'introduces', 'second', 'two', 'adverse', 'amount', 'identifying', 'effectiveness', 'ap', 'jianghan', 'pois', 'sustainable', 'delineated', 'significant', 'uncertainty', 'kappa', 'mapping', 'due', 'challenge', 'authorities', 'extracting', 'separability', 'mean', 'showed', 'advance', 'scholars', 'novel', 'empirical', 'provides', 'mixeduse', 'average', 'index', 'variability', 'previous', 'avoiding', 'important', 'allows', 'deviation', 'studies', 'wuhan', 'nonmuul', 'forest', 'indices', 'di', 'identification', 'function', 'increase', 'within', 'geographic', 'learning', 'still', 'random', 'activities', 'land', 'overall', 'prevalence', 'increasing', 'practices', 'identified', 'machine', 'helldens', 'dynamics', 'kc', 'demonstrated', 'larger', 'monitor', 'impacts', 'single', 'relatively', 'muul', 'features', 'consistent', 'first', 'algorithm', 'pattern', 'identify', 'references', 'different', 'much', 'segmentation', 'integrating', 'coefficient', 'accuracy', 'moreover', 'poi', 'exhibited', 'employed', 'units', 'vibrancy']",2024,"[(1, 0.99866873)]"
BF-SAM: enhancing SAM through multi-modal fusion for fine-grained building function identification,Gong Z.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2024.2399142,0,False,Peking University,Beijing,China,"Building function identification (BFI) is crucial for urban planning and governance. The traditional remote sensing approach primarily focuses on extracting the physical features of buildings, overlooking their functional uses. Recently, progress has been made in urban functional area identification through multi-modal representation learning from multi-source spatial big data. However, the two approaches are disconnected, and each approach is inadequate to tackle the fine-grained BFI problem solely. To address this challenge, this study proposes a multi-modal foundation model for BFI, called BF-SAM, by fine-tuning a large visual model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), with multi-modal features related to urban functions. This model harnesses the segmentation capability of SAM for building delineation and fuses it with multi-modal representation learning for functional identification through a novel multi-modal fine-tuning method for SAM. Modality-dedicated feature extraction methods are devised to learn geographic features from road networks, population density, and points of interest. The validity of BF-SAM was evaluated on datasets from Munich, Beijing, Suzhou, and Hefei, and the importance of multi-modal geographic features was examined through extensive experiments.

Our approach centres equity in infrastructure distribution; we focus on the decision-making process required to achieve the best possible sensor coverage of the geographical area for selected vulnerable populations and visualise trade-offs in coverage inherent in infrastructure distribution. The development of the tool brings together expertise from quantitative geography, urban planning, data science and software engineering, and its technical development is underpinned and shaped by interviews with decision-makers and their iterative feedback. Through this, we ask: how can decision support tools help with the work of building equitable infrastructure? As well as a technical application, our approach develops a conceptual framework for evaluating sensor network purpose and distribution before actual placement. The unique combination of distribution algorithms, user interface and decision-maker input, developed by an interdisciplinary team, offers a novel approach to sensor network conceptualisation and generation.

Learning spatial interaction representation with heterogeneous graph convolutional networks for urban land-use inference,Gong Z.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2024.2379473,0,False,Peking University,Beijing,China,"Urban land use is central to urban planning. With the emergence of urban big data and advances in deep learning methods, several studies have leveraged graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with local functional characteristics from points of interest data and spatial features from flow data to infer urban land use. However, these studies cannot distinguish spatial interaction and spatial dependence in terms of conceptualization and modeling mechanisms and overlook the inadequacy of GCNs in modeling spatial interaction. This study proposes a novel framework—a heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN)—to explicitly account for the spatial demand and supply components embedded in spatial interaction data. Several experiments, including 19 different models and datasets from Shenzhen and London, were conducted to validate the proposed framework and its generalizability within the same and different spatial contexts. The HGCN can distinguish heterogeneous mechanisms in supply- and demand-related modalities of spatial interactions, incorporating both spatial interaction and spatial dependence for urban land-use inference.

To address this gap, this study integrated 3D building data and geographic data to create a comprehensive set of 28 indicators spanning four dimensions: natural environmental conditions, land use, socio-economic factors, and building conditions. These indicators take into account vertical dimensions, dynamic aspects, and fine-scale details. Leveraging the existing UR practices as a positive example, we established an UR potential assessment model at street block scale using Presence and Background Learning combined with extreme gradient boosting algorithms (PBLXGBoost).

Conversely, other type UR exhibit lower accuracy. Street blocks with significant UR potential are predominantly located in Bao’an, Longgang, and Longhua Districts. Furthermore, employing the SHAP model to elucidate the evaluation results uncovered intricate hierarchical, positive-negative, and overlapping relationships among various factors and different UR types, where geographic big data and 3D building information showed strong correlations.

MtSCCD：Land-use scene classification and change-detection dataset for deep learning,Zhou W.,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,10.11834/jrs.20243210,1,False,Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology,Nanjing,China,"Land-Use Scene Classification and change Detection (LUSCD) aim to recognize land-use types and monitor their changes by using Remote-Sensing (RS) images, which play an important role in urban planning and land-use optimization. In the era of RS big data, conventional hand-crafted feature-based methods are infeasible for LUSCD because the extracted features are not sufficiently discriminative for RS images with high complexity. As a novel data-driven paradigm for information extraction from RS images, deep learning provides a new solution for LUSCD. However, the existing publicly available datasets have limited samples and is thus unable to train a successful deep-learning model. Therefore, it has great significance in constructing an open and large-scale LUSCD benchmark. To advance the progress of LUSCD using deep-learning methods, this paper releases a large-scale scene classification and change-detection dataset termed Multi-temporal Scene Classification and Change Detection (MtSCCD).

MtSCCD has 10 land use classes, which are residential land, public service and commercial land, educational land, industrial land, transportation land, agricultural land, water body, green space, woodland, and woodland. Based on the cropped land-use images in MtSCCD, this paper constructs two sub-datasets termed MtSCCD_LUSC (MtSCCD Land Use Scene Classification) and MtSCCD_LUCD (MtSCCD Land Use Change Detection) for land-use scene classification (LUSC) and land-use change detection (LUCD), respectively. MtSCCD dataset has the following characteristics. (1) It is currently the largest publicly available LUSCD dataset, and both of the two sub-datasets (i.e., MtSCCD_LUSC and MtSCCD_LUCD) have 65548 images in total. (2) The images in MtSCCD are split into training set, validation set, and testing set according to the five cities. For example, images from three of the five cities are randomly split into training and validation set, whereas the rest remain to be the testing set. Therefore, MtSCCD has high extensibility, i.e., it can be easily extended to be a larger dataset. (3) For a deep-learning model, the training set and testing set are categorized from different cities, so it is beneficial to demonstrate the model’s generalization ability. (4) MtSCCD has high intra-class diversity, making it a challenging dataset. Based on MtSCCD_LUSC and MtSCCD_LUCD, this paper evaluates several deep-learning feature-based methods for LUSC and LUCD. Specifically, AlexNet, VGG networks (i.e., VGG16 and VGG19), GoogLeNet, and ResNet networks (i.e., ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101) are selected to extract deep-learning features that are then fed into SVM for LUSC. We also evaluate DenseNet, EfficientNet, SENet, ViT, and SwinT for LUSC. Two kinds of LUCD approaches including conventional classification-based methods and current similarity-based methods have been evaluated. Experimental results show that the highest overall accuracy of MtSCCD_LUSC dataset is around 76%, indicating much room for improvement. Regarding LUCD, similarity-based methods particularly similarity learning-based ones outperform classification-based methods by a significant margin, providing a promising research direction for LUCD. This paper presents the currently largest scene classification and change-detection dataset MtSCCD based on high-resolution RS images of the central area of five China cities. MtSCCD contains two subsets MtSCCD_LUSC and MtSCCD_LUCD. Both had 10 land-use types and 65548 images in total. Based on the two sub-datasets, this paper evaluates the performance of several deep networks for scene classification and change detection, expecting to provide baseline results for related researchers. We hope that the MtSCCD dataset can promote this progress in land-use type recognition and monitoring.","['vit', 'models', 'green', 'constructs', 'new', 'learningbased', 'existing', 'several', 'use', 'hangzhou', 'high', 'ie', 'testing', 'open', 'solution', 'set', 'making', 'conventional', 'providing', 'publicly', 'five', 'therefore', 'limited', 'whereas', 'releases', 'datadriven', 'regarding', 'rgb', 'mtsccd', 'deep', 'cities', 'easily', 'resnet', 'recognize', 'contains', 'datasets', 'currently', 'service', 'categorized', 'following', 'monitoring', 'benchmark', 'largest', 'similarity', 'subsets', 'two', 'kinds', 'termed', 'role', 'presents', 'successful', 'lusc', 'including', 'selected', 'remain', 'generalization', 'hope', 'three', 'significant', 'largesize', 'dataset', 'randomly', 'train', 'detection', 'specifically', 'provide', 'ability', 'respectively', 'central', 'hefei', 'evaluates', 'similaritybased', 'advance', 'room', 'novel', 'space', 'areas', 'pixels', 'intraclass', 'residential', 'fed', 'provides', 'around', 'vgg', 'types', 'remotesensing', 'water', 'promising', 'margin', 'training', 'show', 'baseline', 'largescale', 'split', 'approaches', 'type', 'great', 'public', 'important', 'alexnet', 'beneficial', 'rest', 'efficientnet', 'complexity', 'extended', 'related', 'diversity', 'improvement', 'wuhan', 'scene', 'extract', 'rs', 'ones', 'outperform', 'changedetection', 'transportation', 'lucd', 'available', 'extensibility', 'demonstrate', 'optimization', 'cropped', 'paradigm', 'constructing', 'samples', 'educational', 'body', 'learning', 'era', 'woodland', 'particularly', 'resolution', 'svm', 'land', 'overall', 'according', 'unable', 'highresolution', 'commercial', 'total', 'senet', 'changes', 'highest', 'challenging', 'direction', 'aim', 'classes', 'larger', 'expecting', 'monitor', 'discriminative', 'multitemporal', 'area', 'googlenet', 'size', 'example', 'networks', 'densenet', 'extracted', 'progress', 'indicating', 'recognition', 'industrial', 'features', 'characteristics', 'sufficiently', 'nanjing', 'subdatasets', 'captured', 'evaluate', 'classificationbased', 'play', 'researchers', 'different', 'extraction', 'infeasible', 'much', 'landuse', 'current', 'shanghai', 'experimental', 'significance', 'change', 'thus', 'accuracy', 'evaluated', 'luscd', 'swint', 'agricultural', 'deeplearning', 'featurebased', 'validation', 'images', 'handcrafted', 'promote', 'namely', 'classification']",2024,"[(1, 0.40114993), (3, 0.59841937)]"

Areas of Crime in Cities: Case Study of Lithuania,Beconytė G.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi13010001,0,True,Vilniaus Universitetas,Vilnius,Lithuania,"In all countries, cities and their suburbs are the most densely populated areas. They are also the places visited by the largest number of tourists and one-day visitors, who inevitably run the risk of becoming victims of crime. It is, therefore, important, not only at national but also at the international level, to know the structure of urban crime and identify urban areas that differ in terms of their criminogenic situation. This requires a geographical approach and regionalisation based on the quantitative data that can offer it. This paper presents the results of a study using big data regarding violent crime, property crime and infringements against public order registered by the police in 2020 in the territories of three major Lithuanian cities and their suburbs (n = 149,239). Events in open spaces were separately addressed. A series of experiments were carried out using several spatial clustering methods. The automatic zoning procedure method that gave the best statistical results was then tested with different combinations of parameters. In each city, seven types of areas of urban crime were identified. Maps of crime areas (regions) were created for each city. The results of the regionalisation have been interpreted from a socio-geographical point of view and conform with previous sociological urban studies. Seven types of areas of crime have been identified, which are present in all the cities studied and, according to a preliminary assessment, roughly correspond to the socio-demographic and urban zones of each city.

High Rises and Housing Stress: A Spatial Big Data Analysis of Rental Housing Financialization,St-Hilaire C.,Journal of the American Planning Association,10.1080/01944363.2022.2126382,8,True,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,"Problem, research strategy, and findings: The financialization of housing is a rapidly growing concern for planning researchers and policymakers, but the opacity of property ownership in most cities has hampered efforts to rigorously measure the phenomenon. Here we introduce a new approach based on big data methods. By combining web scraping of property assessment, business registry, and rental advertisement data, we reliably identified the networks of property ownership lurking behind anonymous numbered companies and established the extent of financialized rental housing ownership. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a quantitative case study of the financialization of rental housing in Montreal (Canada). Using spatial regression and clustering analyses, we found that there are two distinct types of financialized rental housing ownership in Montreal: one characterized by precarious and student tenants and another characterized by affluent tenants. In general, high proportions of financialized ownership are associated with higher levels of housing stress and dense housing typologies. Takeaway for practice: By demonstrating meaningful differences in housing market outcomes across financialization status—which has not usually been readily accessible to either renters or planners—our findings show the importance of rental market information asymmetry. Planners should treat landlord data as one component of the information necessary to properly regulate a rental housing market. Municipalities should make property ownership information publicly accessible to facilitate public scrutiny of residential land use and more effective protection of tenant rights.","['regulate', 'new', 'web', 'case', 'use', 'high', 'numbered', 'financialization', 'statuswhich', 'publicly', 'distinct', 'rights', 'associated', 'montreal', 'properly', 'policymakers', 'analyses', 'readily', 'plannersour', 'landlord', 'proportions', 'cities', 'clustering', 'outcomes', 'tenants', 'affluent', 'scraping', 'two', 'effectiveness', 'quantitative', 'across', 'combining', 'ownership', 'levels', 'component', 'another', 'takeaway', 'effective', 'phenomenon', 'registry', 'anonymous', 'companies', 'meaningful', 'found', 'general', 'either', 'higher', 'concern', 'rapidly', 'financialized', 'lurking', 'characterized', 'measure', 'strategy', 'housing', 'residential', 'problem', 'types', 'opacity', 'demonstrating', 'show', 'hampered', 'property', 'public', 'typologies', 'treat', 'regression', 'importance', 'one', 'growing', 'stress', 'protection', 'dense', 'extent', 'municipalities', 'necessary', 'introduce', 'demonstrate', 'planners', 'asymmetry', 'accessible', 'established', 'precarious', 'canada', 'practice', 'land', 'identified', 'behind', 'business', 'networks', 'facilitate', 'market', 'advertisement', 'renters', 'efforts', 'rigorously', 'scrutiny', 'researchers', 'tenant', 'reliably', 'usually', 'make', 'rental', 'differences', 'student']",2024,"[(1, 0.9986805)]"

Construction and Connectivity Stress Analysis of Urban Ecological Network in the Nansha New District,Lyu J.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003780,0,False,Ltd.,Guangzhou,China,"Optimizing the ecological network structure and enhancing habitat connectivity are key to ensuring urban ecological security, and the combination of urban big data can more accurately reveal the stress effects of the spatial heterogeneity of human activities on ecological connectivity. In recent years, numerous studies have focused on urban ecological networks; however, they have been limited by the accuracy of correction resistance data and the lack of source corridor identification methods, which makes it challenging to establish ecological networks with attributes. Thus, small- and medium-sized urban ecological network construction and connectivity stress analysis are lacking. In this study, a comprehensive resistance surface was constructed based on Point of Interest(POI) data and land use data; an ecological network with quantitative attributes was constructed using the InVEST habitat quality analysis and circuit theory, and the stress factors and disturbance intensity affecting the corridor connectivity of the network were clarified. Three main conclusions were drawn from the above analysis. First, the overall habitat quality of Nansha New District is good, and the centrality of ecological source areas ranges from 26.8 to 69.26. This centrality is inversely correlated with the source area's weighted center of gravity distance and positively correlated with the source area. The connectivity of most ecological corridors is between 17.56 and 92.56 and is inversely proportional to the corridors' length and resistance. Second, the ecological network of Nansha New District consists of 18 high habitat quality sources, 40 optimal ecological corridors, and 125.70 km2 of potential corridors, spatially showing an introverted spatial pattern of ""dense in the middle and sparse in the north and south."" The corridors in the middle are more densely distributed and shorter in length and have higher connectivity and a concentrated distribution of sources. The north and south ends are scattered with low-level sources and the formation of more long-distance corridors with low connectivity. Finally, the main threatening factors of corridor connectivity in Nansha New District are four types of POI facilities, namely, companies, transportation facilities, shopping consumption, and life services. The numbers of corridors mainly coerced by companies, transportation facilities, life services, and shopping consumption POI are 23, 10, 5, and 2, respectively. Reducing and controlling the number of the above four types of POIs in the latent corridors will effectively enhance the connectivity of ecological networks and alleviate the isolation of source areas, reducing the trend of source islanding and habitat fragmentation. The research results can provide a concrete entry point for the maintenance of an excellent ecological background in Nansha New District in terms of spatial scope and facility renovation, which is of practical significance for the construction of a high-quality urban development benchmark.","['isolation', 'consists', 'new', 'number', 'practical', 'use', 'high', 'controlling', 'conclusions', 'drawn', 'positively', 'human', 'consumption', 'district', 'structure', 'introverted', 'surface', 'makes', 'limited', 'corridors', 'sparse', 'numbers', 'finally', 'security', 'optimizing', 'disturbance', 'recent', 'benchmark', 'spatially', 'second', 'south', 'connectivity', 'scattered', 'quantitative', 'nansha', 'lacking', 'pois', 'proportional', 'trend', 'reducing', 'correction', 'three', 'excellent', 'formation', 'companies', 'four', 'enhance', 'circuit', 'effectively', 'distributed', 'ecological', 'provide', 'habitat', 'combination', 'respectively', 'higher', 'network', 'numerous', 'middle', 'interestpoi', 'alleviate', 'affecting', 'areas', 'concentrated', 'ranges', 'densely', 'inversely', 'terms', 'invest', 'heterogeneity', 'maintenance', 'types', 'shorter', 'years', 'enhancing', 'lowlevel', 'accurately', 'scope', 'highquality', 'facility', 'mainly', 'studies', 'stress', 'ends', 'constructed', 'factors', 'dense', 'center', 'transportation', 'key', 'attributes', 'corridor', 'ensuring', 'identification', 'shopping', 'intensity', 'main', 'coerced', 'centrality', 'establish', 'activities', 'weighted', 'land', 'overall', 'good', 'low', 'small', 'lack', 'threatening', 'showing', 'point', 'effects', 'background', 'mediumsized', 'challenging', 'resistance', 'distribution', 'entry', 'optimal', 'comprehensive', 'gravity', 'focused', 'potential', 'area', 'latent', 'source', 'networks', 'construction', 'islanding', 'length', 'concrete', 'first', 'life', 'pattern', 'quality', 'longdistance', 'facilities', 'clarified', 'renovation', 'significance', 'thus', 'accuracy', 'distance', 'sources', 'fragmentation', 'poi', 'services', 'correlated', 'reveal', 'north', 'namely']",2023,"[(1, 0.99908245)]"
Exploring the factors influencing the spatio-temporal patterns of bus travel and their effects,Chen J.,Journal of Transportation Engineering and Information,10.19961/j.cnki.1672-4747.2023.03.004,1,False,Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology,Xi'an,China,"To better understand the factors influencing the spatio-temporal patterns of bus travel and their effects, data from the Advanced Public Transportation System(APTS)were used to obtain the spatio-temporal characteristics of bus travel, and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN) clustering algorithm was applied to calculate its spatio-temporal regularity. 18 indices of 5 aspects (origin building environment, destination building environment, travel route performance, bus operation performance and bus travel intensity) as independent variables and 4 indices of 2 aspects (spatio-temporal characteristics and spatio-temporal regularity of bus travel) as dependent variables were used to construct the system of variables. The indices were quantified by integrating multi-source data including APTS, POI etc. The structural equation model was established to analyze the effects on the spatio-temporal patterns of bus travel. The results show that bus travel patterns have spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as the distance and time of bus travel during non-peak hours are longer than those during the morning and evening peaks. The bus trips with strong temporal regularity mainly occur in the peak hours, while the bus trips with strong spatial regularity are concentrated in the city center. Travel route performance, bus operation performance, origin building environment, and destination building environment have significant effects on the spatio-temporal characteristics of bus travel (-0.749, -0.413, -0.244, and -0.228, respectively, at the morning peak).

Understanding cycling mobility: Bologna case study,Bertini F.,Computational Urban Science,10.1007/s43762-022-00073-8,0,True,Università di Parma,Parma,Italy,"Understanding human mobility in touristic and historical cities is of the utmost importance for managing traffic and deploying new resources and services. In recent years, the need to enhance mobility has been exacerbated due to rapid urbanisation and climate changes. The main objective of this work is to study cycling mobility within the city of Bologna, Italy. We used six months dataset that consists of 320,118 self-reported bike trips. First, we performed several descriptive analysis to understand the temporal and spatial patterns of bike users for understanding popular roads and most favourite points within the city. The findings show how bike users present regular daily and weekly temporal patterns and the characteristics of their trips (i.e. distance, time and speed) follow well-known distribution laws. We also identified several points of interest in the city that are particularly attractive for cycling. Moreover, using several other public datasets, we found that bike usage is more correlated to temperature and precipitation and has no correlation to wind speed and pollution. We also exploited machine learning approaches for predicting short-term trips in the near future (that is for the following 10, 30, and 60 minutes), which could help local governmental agencies with urban planning. The best model achieved an R square of 0.91 for the 30-minute time interval, and a Mean Absolute Error of 2.52 and a Root Mean Squared Error of 3.88 for the 10-minute time interval.","['patterns', 'points', 'consists', 'new', 'root', 'several', 'ie', 'human', 'users', 'time', 'agencies', 'climate', 'traffic', 'rapid', 'governmental', 'cities', 'bologna', 'datasets', 'months', 'present', 'correlation', 'r', 'following', 'exploited', 'managing', 'recent', 'performed', 'resources', 'predicting', 'temporal', 'square', 'cycling', 'bike', 'popular', 'dataset', 'enhance', 'need', 'due', 'found', 'minutes', 'understand', 'could', 'mean', 'usage', 'follow', 'interval', 'laws', 'achieved', 'exacerbated', 'descriptive', 'trips', 'years', 'show', 'approaches', 'wellknown', 'absolute', 'public', 'attractive', 'importance', 'urbanisation', 'local', 'wind', 'speed', 'main', 'within', 'learning', 'error', 'six', 'temperature', 'particularly', 'deploying', 'italy', 'identified', 'machine', 'changes', 'daily', 'work', 'distribution', 'city', 'precipitation', 'help', 'interest', 'mobility', 'touristic', 'shortterm', 'roads', 'objective', 'characteristics', 'near', 'first', 'historical', 'regular', 'favourite', 'weekly', 'pollution', 'squared', 'future', 'selfreported', 'distance', 'moreover', 'utmost', 'services', 'best', 'correlated']",2023,"[(1, 0.9986685)]"

Latterly, there have been an increasing number of research methods using artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor, quantify, and control the state of these spaces with an aim toward pioneering research in urban studies. However, in informal areas, open-data access tends to lack adequate and updated information, making it difficult to use AI methods. Hence, we propose a methodology for restricted open data collection and preparation for future use in machine learning or spatial data science models for similar areas. To that extent, we examine two peripheral and low-income neighborhoods in Quito, Ecuador—La Bota and Toctiuco—to analyze their public spaces, urban green areas, points of interest, and road networks, and how they address healthy cities criteria. We develop an original methodological approach that combines an index of proximity, accessibility, quantity, and quality for these spaces with geospatial and network analysis techniques.

Therefore, this research studied the sustainable travel prediction ofITS based on big data analysis technology. First, the sustainable travel demand prediction of ITS in the context of big data was defined. Then the spatial correlation of urban areas in the sustainable travel prediction was modeled based on Graph Attention Network (GAT), thus improving the demand prediction accuracy of the model.

An Evaluation System for Regional Collaborative Development of Industries Based on Multi-Source Data: A Case Study of the New Generation Electronic Information Industry Cluster in the Pear River Delta,Lin A.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003757,0,False,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China,"Industrial coordination constitutes a crucial aspect of regional integration, and evaluation of industrial collaboration holds significant practical importance in elucidating industrial processes and advancing industrial development. In this study, a variety of data sources, including enterprise big data and mobile signaling data, were used to construct an evaluation framework for assessing regional collaborative development of intercity industry clusters across two dimensions: latent associations and actual associations. Incorporating factors such as the industrial chain, industrial homogenization, capital, and personnel mobility into a unified framework to assess industrial collaboration, we comprehensively explored collaborative relationships within the electronic information industry in the Pearl River Delta. The Following results were obtained: 1) The Pearl River Delta city cluster, with Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Guangzhou as its core, has established a highly integrated network within the next-generation electronic information industry chain. Examining latent associations reveals a significant level of specialization, particularly within individual metropolitan areas. When considering actual associations, core cities demonstrate close interactions in financial interactions, and strong interconnectedness is also apparent when commuting between these metropolitan areas. 2) Notable collaborative development is evident within the Pearl River Delta's new-generation electronic information industry cluster, particularly involving Shenzhen and Dongguan, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Zhongshan, and Zhongshan and Jiangmen. Of particular interest is the strong differentiated cooperation between Shenzhen and Dongguan. While collaboration among core cities is robust, there is room for improvement in collaboration levels that include peripheral cities,and we suggest maximizing the central leadership roles of Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Guangzhou to nurture diverse industrial clusters in peripheral cities.

"Theory, method, and empirical studies of travel behavior resilience",Huang J.,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,10.11821/dlxb202310008,2,False,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Beijing,China,"Resilience study has long been a focal point in various fields of geography, social science, urban studies, and psychology. Recently, resilience study from multiple disciplines has scrutinized at individual scale. As an important behavior in daily life of human beings, travel behavior is of spatial dependence, spatio- temporal dynamics, and individual heterogeneity. Moreover, how to understand interaction between travel behavior (demand) and traffic supply and their dynamics is a fundamental question in transport studies when transport systems encounter unexpected disturbance. Based on fundamental theories from multiple disciplines including ecology, traffic engineering, and psychology, this paper refines the definition of travel behavior resilience. Also, this paper proposes a conceptual theoretical framework of travel behavior resilience based on dynamic equilibrium characteristics of traffic supply and demand. In general, travel behavior presents three stages of variations, namely, dramatic reduction, rapid growth, and fluctuation recovery, which has been helpful to capture travel behavior resilience triangle. Then we construct a corresponding evaluation methodology, which is suitable for multi- scale and multi- dimensional perspectives. We emphasize that the evaluation of travel behavior resilience should be process-oriented with temporal continuity or capture inflection points of travel behavior. Using multi-source big data such as mobile phone signaling data and smart card data, this paper offers empirical studies on travel behavior resilience, and explores its spatial heterogeneity and group differences. With the location-based analysis, we confirm that people show the greater travel behavior resilience at places where people are engaged in various socio- economic activities. With the group- based analysis, we find that age, socio-economic attributes of mobility groups significantly affect travel behavior resilience. Overall, travel behavior resilience can be one pillar and also offer geographic perspectives to broaden resilience studies. In future, the study of travel behavior resilience on multiple scales and perspectives can explore spatial heterogeneity of traffic re- equilibrium, transport modal differences, and then contribute to urban spatial structure studies. Indeed, the study of travel behavior resilience can provide scientific and technological support for urban management and resilient city construction.","['management', 'recently', 'points', 'social', 'systems', 'helpful', 'continuity', 'technological', 'focal', 'human', 'structure', 'psychology', 'places', 'theoretical', 'stages', 'dramatic', 'capture', 'various', 'indeed', 'scale', 'traffic', 'spatio', 'rapid', 'perspectives', 'dimensional', 'smart', 'modal', 'corresponding', 'contribute', 'disturbance', 'socio', 'engaged', 'equilibrium', 'presents', 'temporal', 'including', 'triangle', 'multisource', 'fluctuation', 'confirm', 'group', 'three', 'demand', 'fundamental', 'dynamic', 'scientific', 'resilient', 'provide', 'general', 'economic', 'understand', 'find', 'theories', 'geography', 'disciplines', 'empirical', 'engineering', 'long', 'transport', 'multiple', 'ecology', 'heterogeneity', 'interaction', 'variations', 'show', 'beings', 'resilience', 'growth', 'behavior', 'supply', 'important', 'emphasize', 'card', 'one', 'scrutinized', 'studies', 'construct', 'unexpected', 'affect', 'attributes', 'socioeconomic', 'encounter', 'significantly', 'geographic', 'proposes', 'travel', 'offer', 'scales', 'inflection', 'suitable', 'people', 'activities', 'overall', 'science', 'offers', 'pillar', 'age', 'multi', 'point', 'daily', 'dynamics', 'individual', 'city', 'reduction', 'groups', 'explores', 'methodology', 'mobile', 'phone', 'locationbased', 'mobility', 'fields', 'dependence', 'construction', 'explore', 'recovery', 'characteristics', 'refines', 'life', 'conceptual', 'signaling', 'processoriented', 'definition', 'support', 'future', 'moreover', 'broaden', 'greater', 'differences', 'namely', 'question']",2023,"[(1, 0.99894255)]"

We used big data crawling, the two-step floating catchment area method, comprehensive equity evaluation of parks, spatial autocorrelation, and non-parametric tests. The results showed inequality in terms of accessibility, area, and quality, with high spatial distribution in the north and low spatial distribution in the south. The accessibility, shortest distance, and total area of urban parks in high-income residential areas were 3.0, 2.1, and 1.8 times higher, respectively, than those of the low-income residential areas.

"Carbon Emission Patterns and Carbon Balance Zoning in Urban Territorial Spaces Based on Multisource Data: A Case Study of Suzhou City, China",Zhang Z.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi12090385,6,True,Suzhou University of Science and Technology,Suzhou,China,"The concept of green and low-carbon development is integrated into territorial spatial planning and district control research. It is one of the systematic policy tools for emission reduction and carbon sequestration, greatly contributing to achieving the double carbon goal. This paper presents a method for measuring the carbon emissions of urban territorial spaces using multisource big data, aiming to identify the spatial patterns and levels of carbon emissions at microspatial scales. The spatial patterns of carbon emissions were used to construct a carbon balance zoning method to evaluate the regional differences in the spatial distribution of carbon emissions, taking Suzhou as an example to achieve carbon balance zoning at the micro scale of the city. Based on our research, the following was determined: (1) Suzhou’s total carbon emissions in 2020 was approximately 240.3 million tons, with the industrial sector accounting for 81.32% of these emissions. The total carbon sink was about 0.025 million tons. (2) In Suzhou City, the high-value plots of carbon emissions are mainly located in industrial agglomeration areas. By contrast, low-value plots are primarily located in suburban areas and various carbon sink functional areas, exhibiting a scattered distribution. (3) The territorial space unit was divided into four functional areas of carbon balance, with 36 low-carbon economic zone units accounting for 37.11%, 29 carbon-source control zone units accounting for 29.90%, 14 carbon-sink functional zone units accounting for 14.43%, and 18 high-carbon optimization zone units accounting for 18.56%.

Improving air quality through urban form optimization: A review study,Li S.,Building and Environment,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110685,6,False,Central South University,Changsha,China,"Air pollution is a significant global environmental issue. Nevertheless, the importance of rational urban planning in mitigating it is frequently disregarded. Conducting air quality optimization simulations that consider UFIs (urban form indicators) is an effective approach for air quality-friendly urban planning. Despite its potential, this technique is still in its infancy. This study aims to identify research gaps and uncertainties by summarizing the current research status of key steps in air quality optimization simulation: selecting UFIs, analyzing impact mechanisms of UFIs on air pollution, building air quality models, and proposing optimization strategies through multiple-scenario predictions. Our findings indicate a lack of consistency in selecting UFIs, and an indicator system considers their impact on air quality and urban planning standards proposed by us might be a viable option. Increases in the proportion of construction land, industrial land, and floor area ratio significantly contribute to air pollution, whereas factors such as forest land, public green space, and sky openness have a noteworthy alleviating effect. Typically, statistical modeling is preferred at the city scale while CFD simulation techniques are used at smaller scales. However, future air quality improving through UFIs optimization still lacks a multi-scale nested tool. Thus, further research is recommended to explore combined impacts of various UFIs on different air pollutants under typical scenarios, and develop intelligent, big data-driven air quality models and tools. This review might contribute to transforming air quality optimization that consider UFIs from fragmented academic research to practical application, thereby assisting in global air pollution mitigation efforts.","['simulations', 'models', 'green', 'recommended', 'preferred', 'transforming', 'practical', 'increases', 'academic', 'noteworthy', 'aims', 'various', 'might', 'global', 'viable', 'sky', 'whereas', 'scale', 'datadriven', 'nevertheless', 'multiplescenario', 'form', 'disregarded', 'proposed', 'contribute', 'indicator', 'ufis', 'scenarios', 'tool', 'modeling', 'effective', 'rational', 'significant', 'ratio', 'typically', 'steps', 'alleviating', 'mitigation', 'space', 'infancy', 'conducting', 'fragmented', 'standards', 'option', 'cfd', 'simulation', 'qualityfriendly', 'frequently', 'summarizing', 'typical', 'public', 'importance', 'indicators', 'gaps', 'strategies', 'forest', 'factors', 'despite', 'predictions', 'us', 'key', 'air', 'optimization', 'significantly', 'scales', 'lacks', 'still', 'land', 'consistency', 'lack', 'openness', 'considers', 'smaller', 'develop', 'intelligent', 'status', 'uncertainties', 'techniques', 'city', 'pollutants', 'consider', 'review', 'potential', 'selecting', 'area', 'impacts', 'assisting', 'combined', 'issue', 'construction', 'environmental', 'explore', 'industrial', 'improving', 'building', 'analyzing', 'efforts', 'quality', 'identify', 'mechanisms', 'different', 'mitigating', 'effect', 'proportion', 'technique', 'current', 'pollution', 'future', 'thus', 'system', 'indicate', 'statistical', 'floor', 'multiscale', 'proposing', 'nested', 'tools', 'thereby']",2023,"[(0, 0.9983635)]"

Insights in a city through the eyes of Airbnb reviews: Sensing urban characteristics from homestay guest experiences,Wang J.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2023.104399,5,False,National University of Singapore,Singapore City,Singapore,"There is a growing interest in deriving insights about cities from crowdsourced data. We advance the discourse by employing homestay guest experience to sense urban characteristics. We evaluate the relationship between subjective perceptions and objective indicators thanks to rich information in textual reviews that we posit reflect urban qualities. Next, we investigate dominant topics about urban characteristics in Airbnb reviews (transportation, greenery, amenities, safety, and noise) with natural language processing techniques, i.e. a rule-based dependency parsing method designed to extract relevant information. Then, we establish the associations between sentiments and proxies representing the physical patterns of urban areas. The multi-scale results of the experiments in three cities (London, Singapore, and NYC) suggest that reviews on homestay platforms reflect transportation convenience, amenities, sense of safety, and noise pollution. The correlation is stronger at a higher administrative division level, while the perception of people on safety is more sensitive at a more granular scale. Densities of transportation and amenities in nearby districts are more likely to be perceived similarly. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of perceptions is possibly affected by the morphology and development of a city, and the diversity of guests.

In China, with continued investment from speculative financial institutions, platform companies aggressively acquired rental houses from individual landlords to develop a platform-based housing rental economy. How does this new rental economy affect housing supply, rents and inequality? This research answers this question by taking Chengdu, China as a case study. A mixed method approach of big data analytics, hedonic pricing model, and field investigations were used to unpack: (a) the pattern of platform houses distribution and its indication of spatial strategies of the financialized platform economy to grab land rent; (b) the effect of such new housing rental economy on housing rents; (c) the effect of the degree of financialization on platform houses' rental prices. The results inform the debate on the disrupt effect of platform economy and housing financialization on equitable urban development, particularly the heterogeneity among cities and countries.

Coordinated development of urban transportation and land use is of great practical significance to reduce traffic congestion, optimize the urban spatial structure, and realize sustainable urban development from the root of problems. With the development of urban society and the advancement of urbanization, as well as the low-carbon, green, and intelligent development trend of the transportation system, traditional urban transportation strategies purely focusing on supply or demand management cannot meet the needs of rapid urban development and the aspirations of the people to live a better life. Urban transportation management needs to focus on comprehensive governance of employment, housing, and transportation and dynamic equilibrium of supply and demand, to realize the coordinated and integrated development with urban spatial layout and land use.

Green infrastructure (GI) in urban fringe areas consists mostly of diversified, small-scale, and scattered green spaces, which simultaneously fulfill the functions of ecological maintenance and urban-rural services. Assessing GI land's value can promote its effective use. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine various GI patches' land value, specifically identifying GI lands with potential for public goods output in the urban fringe, which is oriented toward public welfare output. First, based on a combination of remote sensing technology, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence, we determined that Zhengzhou is divided into core area, edge area, and outer edge area. Second, we found that morphological spatial pattern analysis can accurately identify GI types that play important roles in ecological protection, and the GI lands in the fringe area of Zhengzhou can be characterized as small and fragmented, having poor connectivity, representing a single land type, containing a high proportion of farmland, and a lacking a purely natural landscape. Third, we constructed an evaluation system from ecological maintenance and urban-rural services public goods and identified the high-value GI lands of the edge district of Zhengzhou, including Xianghu Ecological Wetland Park, Die Lake Park, Xiliu Lake Park, Changzhuang Reservoir, Jiangang Reservoir, and greenways along some rivers and roads.

Delineating Walking Catchment of the Existing and Proposed Public Sports Facilities with Open-Source Data: A Case Study of Nanjing,Zhang B.,Applied Spatial Analysis and Policy,10.1007/s12061-022-09499-3,3,False,Nanjing Forestry University,Nanjing,China,"Public sports facilities, featuring exercise equipment and athletic facilities as well as professional support services, serve as a critical exercising and active living hub for citizens. Regarded as a component of public welfare, their distribution usually plays an integral role in urban planning for healthy and active cities. Ensuring that these facilities are located within a reasonable walking distance is crucial for encouraging people to visit them; hence, planners must consider walking distance when evaluating the rationale for these facilities’ existing and proposed distribution. Using Nanjing, China as a case study, we employed the Baidu Maps online mapping service to implement a city-scale catchment delineation of public sports facilities. We scraped the shortest walking routes between residents’ homes and the public sports facilities to delineate the walking catchments, then combined population data to explore the potential gaps between demands and needs. The results revealed significant differences in service areas and potential service capabilities across the sports facilities, demonstrating spatial inequity of sports resources and an insufficient number of public sports facilities in the study area. The walking accessibility of facilities in the peripheral areas was inferior to that of facilities in the central areas, which were expected to be overloaded with a citizen population. If implemented, the proposed plan would remediate this inequity to some extent, but considerable areas outside of 15-min catchments would persist in the study area. These findings highlight the spatial inequity of sports facilities within the city, in both the existing and proposed situation, implying disparities in physical activity opportunities among citizens. Such a straightforward estimation, reinforced with a big data approach, will prove useful for planners and policymakers, although it remains rarely adopted in China for supporting active city planning, and it will be transferable to other cities as a means of rapid assessment.","['exercise', 'adopted', 'transferable', 'number', 'existing', 'walking', 'case', 'delineation', 'outside', 'persist', 'disparities', 'must', 'delineate', 'rationale', 'professional', 'well', 'expected', 'hub', 'evaluating', 'policymakers', 'would', 'rapid', 'revealed', 'capabilities', 'cities', 'encouraging', 'proposed', 'active', 'service', 'located', 'cityscale', 'serve', 'resources', 'role', 'overloaded', 'across', 'component', 'inequity', 'population', 'homes', 'significant', 'implement', 'citizens', 'exercising', 'mapping', 'reinforced', 'central', 'healthy', 'citizen', 'accessibility', 'hence', 'sports', 'areas', 'integral', 'remediate', 'means', 'estimation', 'highlight', 'demonstrating', 'insufficient', 'baidu', 'straightforward', 'public', 'remains', 'implying', 'gaps', 'featuring', 'catchments', 'extent', 'inferior', 'planners', 'ensuring', 'considerable', 'regarded', 'useful', 'within', 'online', 'supporting', 'people', 'plays', 'visit', 'needs', 'crucial', 'living', 'shortest', 'athletic', 'peripheral', 'distribution', 'city', 'consider', 'scraped', 'opportunities', 'potential', 'area', 'combined', 'situation', 'explore', 'physical', 'plan', 'implemented', 'nanjing', 'critical', 'rarely', 'residents', 'maps', 'catchment', 'reasonable', 'routes', 'facilities', 'support', 'although', 'distance', 'usually', 'among', 'equipment', 'services', 'welfare', 'differences', 'employed', 'demands', 'activity', 'prove']",2023,"[(1, 0.40076143), (2, 0.59850246)]"
Analysis of spatial form and structure of commercial pedestrian blocks based on Isovist and big data,Sun Y.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/23998083221138571,4,False,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian,China,"Commercial pedestrian blocks play an indispensable role in urban life. With the development of urban commercial intensification, the construction of commercial pedestrian blocks has ushered in a period of rapid development. To explore the spatial form and structural features of commercial pedestrian blocks, we examined the Qingniwa-Tianjin Street commercial pedestrian block in Dalian, China. We developed a new quantitative research method, using Isovist-App software simulation, big data statistics and Arc GIS analysis methods to explore the spatial morphological structure characteristics of commercial districts. The results show that Tianjin Street’s pedestrian axis has low spatial permeability and monotonous browsing routes. This suggests that the outdoor pedestrian space design does not attract crowds to wander around and stroll. The overall centrality of the space was relatively high, and the spatial accessibility was good. The walking route provided a wide field of vision, stimulating people’s desire for exploration. The space is highly guided, and people can visit according to the designed route. There is a big difference in the spatial aggregation and dispersion of POI facilities. Transportation, sports, and leisure facilities are the most evenly distributed, while shopping and life service street facilities vary considerably. During holidays, the intensity and duration of crowd activities are the largest, followed by working days and weekends. The people in the block mainly gather in the western and southern commercial complexes, and the attractiveness of outdoor pedestrian streets is lower than that of commercial complexes. Node space B has pedestrian streets with varying spatial interfaces and inconsistent visual appeal. The results can be used to support the spatial form and structural renewal design of commercial pedestrian blocks.

Impact of COVID-19 policies on pedestrian traffic and walking patterns,Angel A.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/23998083221113332,12,True,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Haifa,Israel,"The spread of COVID-19 pandemic provoked new policies and restrictions, which had an unprecedented impact on urban mobility and traffic on local and global scales. While changes in motorized traffic were investigated and monitored throughout the recent pandemic crisis in many cities around the world, not much was done on the changes in pedestrian street-traffic and walking patterns during this time. This study aims to identify, quantify, and analyze the changes in pedestrian traffic and walking patterns induced by COVID-19 policies. The “first wave” period of COVID-19 policies in Tel-Aviv, Israel, is used as a case study in this work. The analysis includes over 116 million pedestrian movement records documented by a network of 65 Bluetooth sensors, between 1.2.2020 and 26.7.2020, with a comparison to the equivalent time in 2019 that signifies “normal” pre-COVID-19 conditions. The results show clear correlation between the various COVID-19 policy restrictions and pedestrian count. The shifts to work-from-home and closure of businesses were highly correlated with changes in walking patterns during weekdays, while distinguishing changes in commercial and residential street segments. Nevertheless, while the restrictions dramatically influenced pedestrian movement volume and time of walking, it did not significantly change where people chose to walk, signifying the essentialness of attractive streets, parks and squares for citizens living in urban areas.

Spatial and Temporal Analyses of the Expansion of Built-Up Areas in Nanjing Metropolitan Area Based on Industrial Big Data,Wang Y.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003683,2,False,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"With the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta as a national strategy, urban development in the Nanjing metropolitan area has entered a new stage. However, facing the large differences between the newly joined districts and counties are the key issues of ensuring the driving role of Nanjing as a central city and guiding future high-quality development of the metropolitan area by planning the industrial layout. In this study, enterprise big data and impervious surface data were used as the sources to employ fractal theory, GIS spatial analysis, and other techniques to study the historical evolution characteristics of the built-up areas in the Nanjing metropolitan area. The spatial pattern changes of their expansion intensity have gone through three periods: 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2017. The following stages were observed: 1) In the first stage, the expansion intensity varied widely across the area with the overall pattern being unclear to date. 2) In the second stage, a circular structure emerged gradually with high-value cores located in the main downtown area of Nanjing and the intensity of expansion decreasing from the core to periphery. 3) In the third stage, the number of cores within the circle gradually increased to include Chuzhou Langya District, Huaian Qingjiangpu District, and the border area between Zhenjiang and Changzhou. Based on these stages, the spatial correlation between industrial agglomeration and spatial evolution of built-up areas in the Nanjing metropolitan circle were further analyzed using quantitative indicators such as the Moran index and locational entropy. The following results were obtained. 1) A global positive correlation was observed between the agglomeration degree of manufacturing industries in the metropolitan circle and the spatial evolution intensity of built-up areas during 1990-2015; however, this global-level correlation has decreased in recent years owing to the slower development of manufacturing industries in some regions than the expansion of built-up areas. 2) The structural differences between the manufacturing industries in each region directly influenced the intensity and speed of built-up area expansion. Additionally, different types of manufacturing transfers caused differences in the speed and intensity of expansion of built-up areas in the hinterland of metropolitan circles, affected by the general trend of industrial division of labor in metropolitan circles. 3) The mineral processing industry showed the widest spread among all labor-intensive and low value-added industries. It also possessed the widest diffusion range and played a driving role in the development of built-up areas in each district and county in the long term, whereas for the remaining industries, the initially strong development of built-up areas weakened thereafter. Therefore, it could be argued that the Nanjing metropolitan circle is in a critical period of coordinated regional development, and the initiatives to transfer low-end manufacturing industries to other regions in the circle must be taken in Nanjing while continuously improving its own supremacy by means of collaborative development and innovation. Simultaneously, the sloppy land resource investments in other regions must be altered to improve efficiency.","['facing', 'decreased', 'emerged', 'new', 'number', 'simultaneously', 'large', 'structural', 'delta', 'evolution', 'must', 'district', 'structure', 'owing', 'stages', 'periods', 'improve', 'diffusion', 'efficiency', 'changzhou', 'surface', 'circle', 'global', 'division', 'river', 'slower', 'therefore', 'whereas', 'entered', 'observed', 'circular', 'downtown', 'correlation', 'following', 'located', 'core', 'counties', 'recent', 'positive', 'valueadded', 'second', 'joined', 'role', 'caused', 'zhenjiang', 'enterprise', 'across', 'quantitative', 'hinterland', 'range', 'cores', 'regions', 'driving', 'directly', 'newly', 'trend', 'initiatives', 'unclear', 'three', 'stage', 'guiding', 'periphery', 'spread', 'manufacturing', 'affected', 'collaborative', 'gone', 'transfers', 'highvalue', 'general', 'influenced', 'central', 'could', 'showed', 'county', 'border', 'decreasing', 'circles', 'degree', 'integrated', 'areas', 'long', 'strategy', 'include', 'strong', 'index', 'types', 'means', 'layout', 'expansion', 'globallevel', 'years', 'industries', 'laborintensive', 'played', 'highquality', 'thereafter', 'transfer', 'analyzed', 'obtained', 'indicators', 'national', 'widely', 'yangtze', 'continuously', 'entropy', 'varied', 'metropolitan', 'initially', 'key', 'speed', 'remaining', 'chuzhou', 'coordinated', 'ensuring', 'intensity', 'main', 'locational', 'within', 'lowend', 'builtup', 'third', 'agglomeration', 'low', 'overall', 'land', 'increased', 'industry', 'argued', 'mineral', 'changes', 'date', 'techniques', 'city', 'langya', 'weakened', 'resource', 'moran', 'possessed', 'term', 'area', 'supremacy', 'employ', 'industrial', 'issues', 'gis', 'characteristics', 'innovation', 'nanjing', 'improving', 'critical', 'first', 'investments', 'altered', 'region', 'pattern', 'historical', 'qingjiangpu', 'different', 'widest', 'period', 'sloppy', 'additionally', 'future', 'gradually', 'sources', 'districts', 'processing', 'impervious', 'among', 'huaian', 'fractal', 'labor', 'differences', 'taken', 'regional']",2023,"[(1, 0.6275571), (2, 0.37193215)]"

Limited data exists on the spatial distribution of energy use in Indian cities, particularly amongst low-income households, and most quantitative studies focus primarily on the effect of economic determinants. A microsimulation approach is proposed, using publicly available data and a Bayesian multi-level model to account for effects of current cooking practices (at a household scale), local socio-cultural context and spatial effects (at a city ward scale). This approach offers previously unavailable insight into the spatial distribution of fuel use and residential energy transition within Indian cities. Uncertainty arising from heterogeneity in the population is factored into fuel use estimates through use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The model is applied to four cities in the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and comparison against ward-level survey data shows consistency with the model estimates.

Four future directions are thus proposed: (1) to pay attention to the hierarchical characteristics of urban systems and conduct multi-scale research on the complex interactions within them to capture dynamic features; (2) to leverage remote sensing data so as to obtain diverse urban expansion data and assimilate multi-source spatiotemporal big data to supplement novel socio-economic driving factors; (3) to integrate with interpretable data-driven machine learning techniques to bolster the performance and reliability of DAUE models; and (4) to construct mechanism-coupled urban simulation to achieve a complementary enhancement and facilitate theory development and testing for urban land systems.","['models', 'can', 'not', 'management', 'depict', 'social', 'existing', 'systems', 'deal', 'daue', 'testing', 'capture', 'datadriven', 'perspectives', 'aiming', 'corresponding', 'proposed', 'explored', 'integrate', 'uncovered', 'quantitative', 'remote', 'interactions', 'driving', 'highlevel', 'complex', 'multisource', 'pay', 'four', 'dynamic', 'major', 'scientific', 'provide', 'limitations', 'bolster', 'processes', 'guidance', 'directions', 'novel', 'integrated', 'assimilate', 'enhancement', 'mechanismcoupled', 'sensing', 'reliability', 'expansion', 'simulation', 'summarization', 'supplement', 'leverage', 'feature', 'studies', 'construct', 'factors', 'socioeconomic', 'fully', 'correlations', 'within', 'obtain', 'learning', 'conduct', 'achieve', 'still', 'land', 'machine', 'complementary', 'techniques', 'attention', 'hierarchical', 'facilitate', 'features', 'characteristics', 'implemented', 'finer', 'thorough', 'spatiotemporal', 'identify', 'diverse', 'effectsmechanisms', 'future', 'thus', 'usually', 'multiscale', 'interpretable', 'employed', 'intrinsically']",2023,"[(1, 0.9983908)]"

Empirical analysis of Chengdu, China showed the following: (1) BE factors, including sky view factor, bus stop density, presence of waterscapes, and geographic location significantly, impact jogging activity. (2) The significance and effect of BE factors vary across time. Jogging activities are more sensitive to BE on weekends than on weekdays. (3) Jogging trips are more closely related to BE factors in urban areas than in the suburbs. Jogging activities are mainly affected by the artificial environment in urban areas and the natural environment in suburban areas. Moreover, the effects of multiple BE factors become obvious as trip distance increases.

Investigating urban heat-related health risks based on local climate zones: A case study of Changzhou in China,Ma L.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2023.104402,40,False,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"Assessing heat-related health risks is important for sustainable urban development. Although fine-scale information (e.g., at the community/neighborhood or city block level) is ideal for identifying and mitigating these risks, previous studies have preferred to work at the administrative unit level. High-resolution Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps, i.e., maps of urban “zones” with different microclimates, could help to standardize the analyzing units. In this study, we proposed an LCZ-based risk assessment approach for this purpose. First, an LCZ map of the study site (Changzhou, China) was generated using multisource big data and machine-learning techniques. Next, Crichton's Risk Triangle framework, based on the hazard-exposure-vulnerability risk components, was employed to estimate heat-related health risks. Finally, the relationship between LCZ types and heat-related health risk levels was quantitatively analyzed in detail. The results indicated that at least 60% of LCZ1-5 (compact high-/mid-/low-rise, open high-/mid-rise areas) were designated as high-risk areas, while heat hazard mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in urban planning would benefit more from LCZ 6 (open low-rise). This study, based on the LCZ concept, shows the risk difference at the community level, and can be used for informing and implementing area-level urban planning strategies.

How can we develop road space allocation solutions for smart cities using emerging information technologies?

The methodology has two main directions: (i) analyzing the evolution of concepts and topics explored throughout time by using word frequency counts in abstracts, and (ii) Detecting the main topics expressed in literature by using topic modeling and bigrams in full papers. Additionally, using text mining in reviews can help summarize, detect patterns, and better explore papers. The proposed methodology (and code) is reproducible and can be applied to different research fields. As a case study, we systematically review smart road space allocation literature and the role of big data and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in promoting emerging urban solutions. Even though, recently there has been a significant rise in studies related to smart cities and big data, few papers consider these approaches in road space allocation. On the one hand, temporary solutions are mainly held in local access streets to achieve place-making and reclaim vacant public spaces. On the other hand, intermittent and dynamic solutions are mainly studied in arterials and highways and focused on traffic performance. Ultimately, new road space allocation proposals are not sufficiently studied where there is a high dispute and limited space to allocate space.

Study on the identification of human-natural transitional zone based on big data of human activity in the Taihang Mountains,Sheng A.,Dili Yanjiu,10.11821/dlyj020220517,1,False,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Beijing,China,"Mountainous areas are important carriers of transitional geospatial space. China's mountainous areas cover a large area and are widely distributed, and it is important to carry out research on the identification of mountainous transitional zones for optimizing territorial spatial planning and promoting the quality and efficiency of ecosystem services. The characteristics of temporal dynamic is less considered in current research on the identification of transitional zones. In this paper, from the perspective of crowd activities, three indicators characterizing the gradual change of transitional zones attributes, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics are extracted in the typical transitional geospatial space—the Taihang Mountains, based on Tencent location request data. The change of the three crowd activities characteristics along the human-natural gradient are analyzed. The human-natural transitional zones in the Taihang Mountains are classified by using sliding threshold of landscape metrics, spatio-temporal unsupervised classification methods. The classification results are recognised as human-natural transitional zones by their distribution patterns combined with the data of land use/cover, night lighting, impervious surface, potential crop yield, vegetation net primary productivity and value of ecosystem services. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) In the Taihang Mountains, the degree of temporal dynamics in transitional zones is greater than that of urban areas, where the degree of temporal dynamics in natural areas is the smallest. The temporal dynamics of crowd activities can be used in the classification of human-natural transitional zones. (2) The degree of temporal dynamic distribution of crowd activities along the human-natural gradient may reflect that different human-earth areal systems have different characteristics of crowd behavior patterns. (3) The Taihang Mountains are mainly dominated by natural areas. The urban areas, urban-rural transitional areas and agricultural dominated areas in the study area have changed stably in recent years, while the natural areas and agricultural-natural transitional areas show trends of expansion and contraction, respectively, with changes accounting for about 5.3% and 6.27% of the total area of the study area.

Modeling parcel-level urban development controlling contemporaneous and historical conditions involve computational challenges since data sizes grow quickly beyond the capabilities of conventional statistical-based spatial models. Machine Learning (ML) methods provide computationally feasible methods for large-scale data sets. This paper introduces new ML applications using advanced algorithms and GPU parallel processing to model large-scale urban land developments. Special attention is given to accelerating the construction of spatial weight matrices and training ML models. Specifically, artificial neural networks and random forests are applied to the state of Florida's land-use data, which contains nearly 9 million parcels, to predict parcels with changes in their land use based on historical and neighborhood data. The adaptive Hashing algorithm coupled with GPU parallel processing accelerates the average processing time for identifying the fixed number of nearest neighbors used for accounting spatial autocorrelation, by almost 16,000 times. Also, ML model training times are shortened by 49–547 times using GPU.

Are human activities consistent with planning?

The evaluation of urban planning implementation is important to determine how urban planning can guide spatial activities. However, existing evaluation methods focus more on physical space and largely neglect the object of urban planning—the people themselves. Furthermore, they rarely evaluate whether urban construction truly meets people's demands. This study analyzes the spatial pattern of employment in Changchun, China, based on data on human activities and compares it with the Changchun Master Plan. Spatial patterns and the structure of employment in Changchun were calculated using mobile phone signal data, and the implementation effect of employment space in the master plan was evaluated using human activity patterns. The results demonstrate that although urban planning plays a role in guiding residents’ employment activities, it cannot achieve the plan's desired effect. Many construction lands do not play an effective role in guiding residents’ spatial behavior based on the master plan. Moreover, the commuting distance in suburban areas is much longer than that in central areas. This phenomenon is not caused by the plan's multicenter structure but by the lagging of the urban development behind planning expectations and delays in planning revision.

First, the geospatial information carried by comments is analyzed by GIS to obtain the image structure of the city; second, the picture data in the comments are divided into image types and the type ratio is calculated by the image semantic segmentation method based on deep full convolution neural network.

Assessing Transformation Practices in China under Energy and Environmental Policy Goals: A Green Design Perspective,Yi S.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su15042948,3,True,Huaqiao University,Quanzhou,China,"To achieve energy and environmental policy goals, profound social changes have taken place in the Chinese society. Existing relevant research on energy assessment tends to focus on their respective fields, and policy-level support often requires an assessment of predictable effects based on the overall perspective. In response to this problem, this paper carries out an interdisciplinary study. We chose green design as a new perspective to assess this process. Green design has made important contributions to the sustainable development in the fields of building, construction, and urban planning, which deeply affect the energy consumption in the world. By combing through the development concepts and models of green design in various fields, a comprehensive index—green design index (hereafter referred as to GDI)—is first introduced. Further, a multi-level big data structure of GDI has been built and the development of green design in regions of China based on long-term series is quantitatively assessed. The results of this study show that green design in regions of China has been greatly improved during the inspection period, but there are huge regional differences. The required policies and implementation routes also need to be adapted to local conditions. This paper first introduces a credible quantitative analysis framework of green design, and a corresponding research foundation for energy transition research based on green design.","['models', 'green', 'social', 'new', 'existing', 'tends', 'structure', 'consumption', 'various', 'transition', 'assess', 'goals', 'greatly', 'relevant', 'conditions', 'society', 'corresponding', 'carries', 'policies', 'hereafter', 'gdi', 'introduces', 'longterm', 'quantitatively', 'series', 'quantitative', 'regions', 'profound', 'sustainable', 'concepts', 'respective', 'need', 'made', 'multilevel', 'requires', 'indexgreen', 'gdiis', 'contributions', 'inspection', 'implementation', 'world', 'problem', 'index', 'chinese', 'huge', 'referred', 'combing', 'predictable', 'show', 'perspective', 'important', 'required', 'affect', 'local', 'built', 'assessed', 'achieve', 'introduced', 'deeply', 'overall', 'energy', 'changes', 'effects', 'policy', 'comprehensive', 'policylevel', 'fields', 'construction', 'adapted', 'environmental', 'building', 'first', 'focus', 'routes', 'support', 'period', 'chose', 'improved', 'credible', 'foundation', 'response', 'place', 'taken', 'differences', 'often', 'regional', 'interdisciplinary']",2023,"[(1, 0.7184826), (2, 0.28048584)]"
Understanding railway usage behavior with ten million GPS records,Jin Y.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2022.104117,1,False,The University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"Considering the essential role of public railway transport in urban planning and development, it is crucial to understand railway travel behavior. With data and survey cost limitations, the railway travel behavior considered in previous studies suffers from a lack of comprehensiveness. Based on millions of GPS records, we analyzed railway usage behavior and then classified 36 stations on the JR Yamanote and JR Chuo lines in Tokyo based on railway usage behavior. To explore the built environment characteristics of each classification and the relationship between railway usage behavior and the built environment, we generated a series of built environment indicators based on the functional attributes around stations. The results show that railway usage behavior in non-secondary catchment areas correlates strongly with the commercial and functional attributes of stations. For non-core catchment areas around stations, consumption level, housing price, and passenger load are the main influencing indicators. Beyond these analysis results, we also present a policy discussion on railway station construction. We found that GPS records constitute valuable information for assessing station usage and neighborhood construction.

Pollution surfaces were established with geographically weighted regression models and impact factors analysis was implemented by boosted regression tree models. The results showed that weekdays and weekends had different spatial distributions of PM, and the exposure risk was lower on weekends. High exposure risks of PM10 were concentrated in the first ring zone (76.53 people·m−2·μg·m−3) and residential-commercial land (292.34 people·m−2·μg·m−3).

A crucial aspect of ‘smartness’ is the systematic availability and reliance on large volumes of big data for daily, regular and idiosyncratic land management interventions. Yet, land management and spatial planning also comprise of methodological and axiological choices on land laws and regulations, priority setting in land governance, mitigating socio-spatial unintended impacts and fostering public participation and ownership. Consequently, there is a need to understand how technological trends can effectively support and transform land management to a smart land management. This chapter reviews the practical connections between land management and spatial planning and discusses how geospatial data and technologies can contribute to make these fields smart. It takes the new capital of Indonesia, IKN, as case study to discuss how a new city design and development can be smart from the onset.","['asia', 'become', 'governance', 'ownership', 'management', 'indonesia', 'new', 'practical', 'large', 'case', 'geospatial', 'public', 'setting', 'impacts', 'technological', 'fields', 'discusses', 'technologies', 'systematic', 'faces', 'fostering', 'reliance', 'effectively', 'need', 'reviews', 'axiological', 'various', 'indeed', 'onset', 'choices', 'consequently', 'yet', 'ikn', 'understand', 'available', 'designs', 'monitored', 'comprise', 'connections', 'unintended', 'redesigned', 'regulations', 'smart', 'conditions', 'chapter', 'regular', 'aspect', 'mitigating', 'sociospatial', 'discuss', 'support', 'transform', 'obvious', 'interventions', 'contribute', 'currently', 'laws', 'idiosyncratic', 'methodological', 'evaluated', 'participation', 'land', 'capital', 'make', 'practices', 'challenges', 'availability', 'takes', 'trends', 'crucial', 'smartness', 'volumes', 'priority', 'daily', 'city']",2023,"[(3, 0.99766356)]"

Urban Scale Digital Twins Vis-à-Vis Complex Phenomena: Datafication and social and environmental equity,Charitonidou M.,Proceedings of the International Conference on Education and Research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe,10.52842/conf.ecaade.2023.2.821,2,True,Leeds Beckett University,Leeds,United Kingdom,"The paper analyses the role of the urban scale digital twins in conceiving and designing urban spaces. Urban scale digital twins are virtual replicas of cities. Within the current context of data-driven societies, they are often used to test scenarios related to sustainable environmental design. An important reorientation concerning the role of the urban scale digital twins in urban planning is that from technical to the socio-technical perspectives. The debates on Smart Cities often focus on technical issues, neglecting the social issues concerning urban planning. At the core of the paper is the idea that in order to combine environmental equity and social equity, it is pivotal to bring together the social and the technical viewpoints of urban planning. This can become possible through the adoption of socio-technical perspectives. The paper explores the role of complexity perspectives based on new types of urban data in reshaping urban planning decision making methods. It pays special attention to datafication, Smart Cities, digital exclusion, Big Data, IoT, AI, Machine Learning, automated data collection, and data analytics. It also investigates how urban scale digital twins can measure, describe and analyze complex phenomena. Particular emphasis is placed on how urban scale digital twins help develop new data driven scenarios, promote sustainable development goals, and shape new participatory design methods.

Pedestrian Movement and the Built Environment – A Big Data-Based Analysis,Angel A.,Lecture Notes in Intelligent Transportation and Infrastructure,10.1007/978-3-031-23721-8_61,0,True,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Haifa,Israel,"Over the years, the urban planning literature has focused substantial attention on walkability research, aiming to enhance physical activity and healthy communities in the city through urban planning and design. However, while motorized traffic research seems to gain momentum in combining innovative technologies for traffic monitoring in recent years, pedestrian research seems to be left behind; the common tools used to collect pedestrian data are limited in time and scale. The increasing availability of quantitative data on the built environment holds great potential for a new generation of walkability studies, based on direct evidence of pedestrians’ flow around the city. This study aims at scrutinizing the added value of big data and crowdsourced big data to pedestrian and walkability research while experimenting with a new emerging technology of Bluetooth sensors. We used a dataset of over 53 million pedestrian records, monitored in 83 street-segments in Tel-Aviv, Israel, to analyze tempo-spatial dynamics of pedestrian movement at the street-level. The data was collected 24/7 for five months, including the time of COVID-19’s first lockdown. The results provide new insights on the relationship between attributes of the built environment and pedestrian movement, while identifying and evaluating attractive street segments across temporal changes.

Automatic image annotation system using deep learning method to analyse ambiguous images,Al-Shammary A.A.,Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences,10.21533/pen.v11i2.3517.g1268,0,False,Higher Institute of Biotechnology of Sfax (ISBS),Sfax,Tunisia,"Image annotation has gotten a lot of attention recently because of how quickly picture data has expanded. Together with image analysis and interpretation, image annotation, which may semantically describe images, has a variety of uses in allied industries including urban planning engineering. Even without big data and image identification technologies, it is challenging to manually analyze a diverse variety of photos. The improvements to the Automated Image Annotation (AIA) label system have been the subject of several scholarly research. The authors will discuss how to use image databases and the AIA system in this essay. The proposed method extracts image features from photos using an improved VGG-19, and then uses nearby features to automatically forecast picture labels. The proposed study accounts for both correlations between labels and images as well as correlations within images. The number of labels is also estimated using a label quantity prediction (LQP) model, which improves label prediction precision. The suggested method addresses automatic annotation methodologies for pixel-level images of unusual things while incorporating supervisory information via interactive spherical skins. The genuine things that were converted into metadata and identified as being connected to pre-existing categories were categorized by the authors using a deep learning approach called a conventional neural network (CNN) - supervised. Certain object monitoring systems strive for a high item detection rate (true-positive), followed by a low availability rate (falsepositive). The authors created a KD-tree based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to speed up annotating. In order to take into account for the collected image backdrop. The proposed method transforms the conventional two-class object detection problem into a multi-class classification problem, breaking the separated and identical distribution estimations on machine learning methodologies. It is also simple to use because it only requires pixel information and ignores any other supporting elements from various color schemes. The following factors are taken into consideration while comparing the five different AIA approaches: main idea, significant contribution, computational framework, computing speed, and annotation accuracy.

Population Mobility and Urban Development,Yang Z.,Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements,10.1007/978-981-19-6641-5_2,0,False,Weifang University,Weifang,China,"Development is the primary issue facing cities in the world today. Urban development is inseparable from the support of labor. The population mobility between regions provides a guarantee for the sustainable development of the city. Therefore, the dynamics of population mobility and its interactive relationship with urban development requires more in-depth research. The background of the development of China’s urbanization, the intersection of interdisciplinary methods, and the emergence of new data enable more extensive research on this topic. This chapter takes Chinese cities as the research objects and explores the interactive relationship between urban development and population mobility. We emphasize the importance of exploring the interaction between population mobility and urban development at different spatial and temporal scales. Combined with official statistics and emerging big data, we describe the dynamics of population mobility between cities and within cities. With the help of spatial econometric model and other mathematical statistical models, we analyzed the urban development factors affecting population mobility, including urban economy, urban policies, and urban built environment.

The prospects of artificial intelligence in urban planning,Sanchez T.W.,International Journal of Urban Sciences,10.1080/12265934.2022.2102538,45,False,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Blacksburg,United States,"Over the past several decades, urban planning has considered a variety of advanced analysis methods with greater and lesser degrees of adoption. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is probably the most notable, with others such as database management systems (DBMS), decision support systems (DSS), planning support systems (PSS), and expert systems (ES), having mixed levels of recognition and acceptance (Kontokosta, C. E. (2021). Urban informatics in the science and practice of planning. Journal of Planning Education and Research, 41(4), 382–395. doi:10.1177/0739456X18793716; Yigitcanlar, T., Desouza, K.

Advances in information technologies have moved very slowly in the field of urban planning, more recently concerning ‘smart city’ technologies while revolutionizing other domains, such as consumer goods and services. Baidu, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and many others are using these technologies to gain insights into consumer behaviour and characteristics and improve supply chains and logistics. This is an opportune time for urban planners to consider the application of AI-related techniques given vast increases in data availability, increased processing speeds, and increased popularity and development of planning related applications. Research on these topics by urban planning scholars has increased over the past few years, but there is little evidence to suggest that the results are making it into the hands of professional planners (Batty, M.

In China, land resource management has always faced a dilemma between the excessive demands of land exploitation and the conservation of natural resources and ecological environments. Despite the challenges, recent technological advancements have offered the promise for government officials to better manage land resources using digital and big data technologies. The Chinese government has embarked on smart initiatives for land resource management (SiLRM) by integrating digital technologies with land resource management. However, the field of land resource management lacks a comprehensive framework for incorporating these technologies. This paper first reviews the history and content of SiLRM in China and presents three case studies that demonstrate how SiLRM are currently implemented in China. It then develops a framework for how government officials should deploy advanced IT technologies. The proposed framework, as well as some policy recommendations, could shed light on the future development of an integrated spatial governance system in China, particularly against the backdrop of a recent national reform that integrates multiple planning systems.

Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Subway Travel by the Elderly Based on Activity Space: A Case Study of Kunming,Xiong M.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003596,2,False,"Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences",Beijing,China,"With the aging of society, the travel activities of the elderly, as a vital part of resident travel, have become the focus of transportation management in most cities. The widespread application of big data has enabled travel behavior to be analyzed in more detail, with the results revealing actual travel patterns and helping to gain an in-depth understanding of the daily travel of residents. In studies on travel patterns, several methods can be used to analyze the daily activity patterns of the elderly by combining big data with the theory of activity space. However, studies on the internal disparity in the travel behavior of the elderly remain limited. Hence, we conducted a comparative analysis of the travel behavior of age groups within the elderly from the perspective of activity space based on the smart card data of the Kunming subway system. In the analysis, we first compared the basic travel behavior of the elderly and nonelderly. Based on the findings, we divided the elderly who took the subway into 60-69- and over-70-year-old groups. Second, we compared the travel behavior and activity spaces of these two groups using a statistical and spatial analysis approach. The results showed significant differences between the elderly and nonelderly groups, the 60-69-year-old group, and the over-70-year-old group. (1) We found spatiotemporal differences in travel behavior between the elderly and nonelderly. Compared to the nonelderly group, the elderly group was less mobile. Their single-subway travel duration and frequency were lower, and they traveled more during the early peak hours. Their activity range was relatively concentrated in the city center, and their travel purposes showed a stronger orientation toward leisure and medical needs. (2) With increasing age, the elderly were less mobile, and their dependence on public transport increased. In detail, the over-70-year-old group had a shorter travel duration as well as a smaller activity space, whereas their travel frequency and number of visited stations were higher than those of the primary age group. Compared with the 60-69-year-old group, the daily activity pattern of the elderly over 70 years old could be summarized as being within a smaller activity space and higher in frequency. (3) The distribution of activity spaces of the two elderly groups was similar to each other, both in areas along metro lines 1, 2, and 3, without line 6. It indicated that the daily activities of the elderly mainly occur in central urban areas with high population densities. Regarding differences, the activity spaces of those over 70 years old were more concentrated in the densely inhabited districts along metro line 3, whereas the activity spaces of the 60-69-year-old group spread to low-density areas in the south and east. These findings may imply that factors, such as the built environment, largely restrict the subway travel of older people. In other words, their daily activities rely on facilities and transit more heavily. In conclusion, our results reveal the subway travel behavior and daily activity patterns of different-aged elderly groups, which verify the feasibility of smart card data in activity space analysis. Additionally, our study provides ideas for urban planning and transportation management in the aging era to promote social space equity.","['become', 'patterns', 'management', 'social', 'number', 'several', 'enabled', 'high', 'analyze', 'nonelderly', 'well', 'resident', 'widespread', 'hours', 'line', 'singlesubway', 'limited', 'whereas', 'regarding', 'smart', 'cities', 'society', 'feasibility', 'similar', 'aging', 'second', 'two', 'gain', 'south', 'took', 'subway', 'combining', 'remain', 'peak', 'range', 'population', 'group', 'significant', 'spread', 'part', 'found', 'ideas', 'higher', 'inhabited', 'could', 'central', 'less', 'actual', 'showed', 'toward', 'stations', 'may', 'imply', 'comparative', 'verify', 'hence', 'metro', 'summarized', 'space', 'occur', 'areas', 'concentrated', 'revealing', 'transport', 'indicated', 'densely', 'provides', 'vital', 'shorter', 'detail', 'early', 'years', 'visited', 'along', 'conclusion', 'perspective', 'behavior', 'internal', 'public', 'old', 'elderly', 'heavily', 'card', 'analyzed', 'orientation', 'mainly', 'restrict', 'studies', 'compared', 'leisure', 'factors', 'lines', 'center', 'transportation', 'lowdensity', 'built', 'lower', 'within', 'east', 'older', 'travel', 'era', 'kunming', 'people', 'activities', 'spaces', 'needs', 'primary', 'increasing', 'increased', 'age', 'helping', 'smaller', 'densities', 'daily', 'city', 'distribution', 'groups', 'conducted', 'traveled', 'frequency', 'mobile', 'indepth', 'purposes', 'largely', 'relatively', 'dependence', 'duration', 'without', 'divided', 'basic', 'first', 'words', 'focus', 'disparity', 'pattern', 'residents', 'spatiotemporal', 'facilities', 'additionally', 'equity', 'system', 'districts', 'statistical', 'stronger', 'rely', 'environment', 'differences', 'reveal', 'activity', 'medical', 'differentaged', 'transit', 'promote']",2022,"[(1, 0.99910045)]"

Traditional methods mainly focus on the heterogeneity of regional resources and environment rather than residents’ behavioral activities. However, residents’ behavioral activities are one of the most important factors influencing urban spatial form. Fortunately, the emergence of big data, especially phone signaling data, provides alternative data sources to understand the dynamic resident behavior activity space, which is significant for people-oriented urban development. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for UGB delineation based on multi-source big data and multi-objective constraints, which emphasizes humanism and the low-carbon concept in urban expansion simulation. The multi-objective constraints are constructed from the evaluation of resident activity space expansion potential, the evaluation of urban construction suitability, the evaluation of ecological conservation importance, and the human survival materials limitation. We apply the framework to Ningbo, and the results show that the framework under multi-objective constraints from a people-oriented and low-carbon perspective is more reliable and comprehensive than that without constraints. The findings also show that the UGB delineation based on multi-source big data has higher accuracy and better performance.

Impact of particulate matter and urban spatial characteristics on urban vitality using spatiotemporal big data,Lee S.h.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2022.104030,14,False,Korea Maritime Institute,Busan,South Korea,"The rapid development of cities has caused various environmental problems. Recently, in Korea, citizens' interest and concerns regarding particulate matter are on the rise. Particulate matter has an adverse impact on the health and activities of individuals, and this can lead to a decline in urban vitality. The maintenance and management of urban vitality is essential for ensuring a sustainable and livable city; consequently, an understanding of environmental impact is indispensable. Thus, this study aims to demonstrate the impact of particulate matter on urban vitality by using the spatiotemporal big data of particulate matter and floating population that targets Seoul—a world-class high-density city in South Korea. Further, it aims to examine the impact of the spatial and physical characteristics of neighborhoods on the vitality of cities and neighborhoods. The data analyzed the impact of particulate matter on neighborhood vitality by using a spatial panel model that considered the characteristics of time series and local data. The analysis demonstrated that the impact of particulate matter varied during weekdays and weekends. It did not significantly affect the numerous mandatory activities of city dwellers and vitality on weekdays. However, on weekends, when there are relatively more selective activities, particulate matter was found to affect the decline of urban vitality. This means that people are very anxious about particulate matter, and that it leads them to reduce their visits whenever possible on weekends, when selective activities are predominant. In the spatial characteristics of the neighborhood, the degree of development, land use for commercial and business purposes, land-use mix, access to public transportation, and pedestrian environment were found to significantly impact the increase of urban vitality. However, areas with significant land use for residential and industrial purposes, and areas with high altitudes were found to have relatively low urban vitality.

Research on Correlation between Spatial Quality of Urban Streets and Pedestrian Walking Characteristics in China Based on Street View Big Data,Xuan W.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000888,9,False,Hefei University of Technology,Hefei,China,"Recently, China's urban construction has gradually shifted from incremental development to quality improvement, and urban residents' demand for a better travel environment has become stronger. Therefore, as the main carrier of urban slow traffic and an important part of public space, streets are gradually becoming the focus of urban planning. This study starts from the perspective of the residents' needs and selects the measurement indicators from multiple dimensions. The combination of big data analysis and field observations makes up for the shortcomings in the subjective methods, single measurement dimensions, and low data accuracy in previous studies and provides a comprehensive measurement method for the spatial quality of typical streets in China, and provides theoretical support and a scientific basis for urban sustainable development. This study used the Bijiashan Block, Hefei, Anhui Province, China, as an example. Based on the street view big data and technologies, such as point of interest (POI) spatial analysis, road network accessibility analysis, and machine learning algorithm, this study conducted a quantitative evaluation of the street space quality from four dimensions: (1) visual perception; (2) functional attribute; (3) road network structure; and (4) spatial form. In addition, quantitative measurements of pedestrian walking characteristics are conducted based on pedestrian flow rate and walking speed. Correlation and regression analyses are adopted to explore the correlation between street space quality and pedestrian walking characteristics and the impact of each indicator.

This significantly affects the happiness of residents around the URs, the overall image of the city, and the environment, and it has become an important issue in urban construction. At present, the types of urban ruins mainly include industrial ruins, abandoned urban buildings, and war sites. Generally, methods such as demolition and reconstruction of original buildings or upgrading and transformation are used to reuse URs, and some of them have achieved fruitful results. However, the current renovation of URs is based on fragmented renovation strategies for different URs without a systematic and universally applicable renovation methodology. With the development of artificial intelligence, technologies such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Easy DL, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can provide technical support for urban ruin reconstruction, from design to operation.

The results showed that TAHR varied dramatically at multiple temporal scales. Peak‒trough shapes of TAHR variations were found at hourly levels, while increasing trends were found at daily levels. Central downtown areas experienced significant variation trends at both hourly and daily levels. Sinks of TAHR were more closely associated with workplaces, while TAHR sources were more closely associated with residential functional zones at daily levels.

Spatial Calculation of urban built environment stock：progress and prospects,Yi B.,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,10.11834/jrs.20222083,2,True,Beijing Key Laboratory of Spatial Information Integration and 3S Engineering Application,Beijing,China,"The urban built environment is the manufactured environment in which human beings live. The stock of urban built environment refers to the material quality of buildings and infrastructure in cities. It is a new direction for digital city construction to reveal the spatial distribution of urban built environment stock, which can help us understand the urban development pattern and manage urban resources and waste more effectively. Developing an urban circular economy and realizing sustainable urban development is essential. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize and sort out the current spatial calculation method of built environment stock.This paper introduces in detail the theoretical basis and development status of three methods for spatial calculation of urban built environment stock: the top-down method, bottom-up method, and remote sensing calculation method. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The top-down approach has a complete set of theoretical foundations and algorithm models, which can well perform material flow analysis at large scales. However, this method cannot achieve high spatial resolution, so they are not suitable for analyzing development within cities. The bottom-up approach can obtain detailed stock distribution results within cities, but the scope of research is often limited due to data limitations. As for remote sensing calculation, the correlation between night light remote sensing and economic is mainly used to calculate stock results in the areas lacking statistical data. However, the night light remote sensing data will degrade the reliability of quantitative analysis due to the background noise and radiation saturation effect. Thus, stocks data with high spatial resolution will be impossible to acquire. These three traditional methods are often unable to consider the large scale of space and time and high precision. However, in the era of big geographic data, more data sources have brought new research directions for stock calculation. Geo Big Data and Earth Observation data play an essential role in developing earth science, environmental science, remote sensing science, and geographic information science. Combining these wide-coverage, high-precision, and fast-update data and machine learning methods have been widely used in poverty surveys, energy consumption, etc. This paper proposes a framework that combines big geographic data and machine learning for stock calculation based on the above background. We expect that the end-to-end method of directly estimating grid stocks through data reduces manual involvement and workload to the greatest extent possible. At the same time, this method benefits large-scale applications. It is suited for the extension to areas missing statistical data due to the extensive coverage, high spatial resolution, and low cost of remote sensing.We should note that the transfer impact of the model may not be perfect due to the heterogeneity of geographic space and the black box characteristics of deep learning. Furthermore, it is impossible to test the model's prediction results with high resolution due to the unavailability of ground truth. Despite its drawbacks, this migration model has the potential for large-scale, high-resolution stock calculation in future works.","['models', 'can', 'not', 'new', 'large', 'manual', 'method', 'foundations', 'high', 'human', 'night', 'consumption', 'theoretical', 'set', 'well', 'essential', 'time', 'estimating', 'therefore', 'limited', 'buildings', 'scale', 'works', 'extensive', 'stockthis', 'complete', 'cities', 'degrade', 'note', 'deep', 'circular', 'workload', 'correlation', 'traditional', 'calculate', 'introduces', 'grid', 'resources', 'noise', 'role', 'quantitative', 'combining', 'remote', 'box', 'directly', 'lacking', 'sustainable', 'drawbacks', 'observation', 'extension', 'manage', 'black', 'refers', 'three', 'combines', 'waste', 'saturation', 'impossible', 'acquire', 'effectively', 'due', 'limitations', 'economic', 'understand', 'may', 'directions', 'basis', 'radiation', 'space', 'reduces', 'areas', 'manufactured', 'disadvantages', 'calculation', 'heterogeneity', 'benefits', 'developing', 'widecoverage', 'test', 'sensing', 'detail', 'expect', 'reliability', 'geo', 'beings', 'largescale', 'scope', 'precision', 'topdown', 'digital', 'transfer', 'cost', 'mainly', 'suited', 'widely', 'coverage', 'despite', 'us', 'extent', 'ground', 'necessary', 'bottomup', 'advantages', 'stocks', 'built', 'highprecision', 'obtain', 'within', 'geographic', 'learning', 'proposes', 'truth', 'scales', 'light', 'achieve', 'detailed', 'stock', 'era', 'surveys', 'suitable', 'resolution', 'involvement', 'low', 'science', 'fastupdate', 'perfect', 'unable', 'energy', 'machine', 'sensingwe', 'highresolution', 'infrastructure', 'status', 'background', 'summarize', 'distribution', 'direction', 'city', 'consider', 'greatest', 'furthermore', 'sort', 'prediction', 'applications', 'help', 'potential', 'construction', 'flow', 'material', 'environmental', 'economy', 'perform', 'live', 'characteristics', 'unavailability', 'analyzing', 'algorithm', 'pattern', 'quality', 'realizing', 'play', 'effect', 'possible', 'missing', 'current', 'earth', 'future', 'thus', 'sources', 'endtoend', 'statistical', 'environment', 'reveal', 'poverty', 'often', 'brought', 'migration', 'etc']",2022,"[(1, 0.5841118), (3, 0.41541162)]"

Furthermore, the dimensions of the taxi flow density and the road density in low vitality blocks can be distinguishable from other blocks. Results showed a stronger relationship between land-use diversity and urban vitality.

However, the complete extraction of time series features is one of the difficulties.

Therefore, in this study, spatial location big data were first fused with NTL data, which effectively improved the accuracy of urban built-up area extraction. Then, a wavelet transform was used to fuse the data, and multiresolution segmentation was used to extract the urban built-up areas of Zhengzhou.

Understanding (urban) spaces through form and function,Arribas-Bel D.,Habitat International,10.1016/j.habitatint.2022.102641,26,True,The Alan Turing Institute,London,United Kingdom,"This paper presents the notion of spatial signatures as a characterisation of space based on form and function designed to understand urban environments. The spatial configuration of the dif-ferent components of cities is relevant for at least two main reasons. On the one hand, it encodes many aspects of the phenomena that created such an arrangement in the first place. On the other, once in place, this arrangement of urban form and function underpins many outcomes, from economic productivity to environmental sustainability. Our approach unfolds in three main stages. First, we propose a new spatial unit –the Enclosed Tessellation (ET) cell– to delineate space in a way that is exhaustive and matches the underlying processes at which urban form and function operate. Second, we propose to attach a large variety of form and function-based characters to ET cells to describe each of these units. Third, to build spatial signatures, information on ET cells can be clustered using unsupervised learning techniques. This process results in a theory-informed, data-driven typology of space that follows form and function. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach to a variety of data landscapes and cultural backgrounds by providing five illustrations of spatial signatures for five cities across five continents.

This paper provides a systematic review of the use of UL in urban studies based on 140 publications. Firstly, the topic, technique, application, data type, and evaluation method of each paper are recorded, deriving statistical insights into the evolution and trends. Clustering is the most prominent method, followed by topic modeling. With the strong momentum of deep learning, a growing application field of UL methods is representing the complex real-world urban systems at multiple scales through multi-source data integration. Subsequently, a detailed review discusses how UL is applied in a broad range of urban topics, which are concluded by four dominant themes: urbanization and regional studies, built environment, urban sustainability, and urban dynamics. Finally, the review addresses common limitations regarding data quality, subjective interpretation, and validation difficulty of the results, which increasingly require interdisciplinary knowledge.

Assessing the value of user-generated images of urban surroundings for house price estimation,Chen M.,Landscape and Urban Planning,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104486,18,True,University College London,London,United Kingdom,"Determinants of housing prices are particularly significant for monitoring and understanding housing prices. Traditional variables are measured through official statistics or questionnaire surveys, which are labour intensive and time-consuming. New forms of data, such as point of interest or street view imagery, have been used to extract housing location and neighbourhood features, but they cannot capture how different individuals recognised and evaluated the properties nearby, which may also be relevant in the house price estimation. Therefore, this study investigates whether user-generated images may be used to monitor and understand housing prices and how they influence real estate values. Within this context, perceived scenes features are extracted and quantified to blend with commonly used determinants of housing prices. Two machine learning algorithms, random forest and gradient boosting machines, are utilised and deployed for integration with a typical housing price modelling-hedonic price model. By comparing the performance and interpretability of different models, the relative importance of features and how they influence the estimation power of the models is visualised and analysed. The findings suggest that random forest predictions perform the best and are interpretable, with geotagged Flickr images adding 4.6% to the model's accuracy (R2) from 61.9% to 66.5%. Although user-generated images increase minor value in house price estimation, they may be used as a supplementary data source to capture perception features for house price estimation.

However, previous studies have often neglected the multiscale problem in exploring the association between environmental features and crime occurrence. Therefore, in this study, a multiscale analysis method was proposed to quantitatively study the influence of street built environment on crime occurrence using street-view images. Firstly, inspired by the theory of crime prevention through environmental design, we established a multiscale descriptive framework for environmental features with simultaneous consideration of the physical features and scene perception of street built environment. Then, a multiscale geographically weighted regression model was used to explore the spatial scale of influence for different streetscape features on crime occurrence. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method could reflect the difference of the spatial scale of various environmental features on crime, thereby uncovering the association between environmental features and crime occurrence with better accuracy.

Abstracting mobility flows from bike-sharing systems,Kon F.,Public Transport,10.1007/s12469-020-00259-5,9,True,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"Bicycling has grown significantly in the past ten years. In some regions, the implementation of large-scale bike-sharing systems and improved cycling infrastructure are two of the factors enabling this growth. An increase in non-motorized modes of transportation makes our cities more human, decreases pollution, traffic, and improves quality of life. In many cities around the world, urban planners and policymakers are looking at cycling as a sustainable way of improving urban mobility. Although bike-sharing systems generate abundant data about their users’ travel habits, most cities still rely on traditional tools and methods for planning and policy-making. Recent technological advances enable the collection and analysis of large amounts of data about urban mobility, which can serve as a solid basis for evidence-based policy-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical method that can be used to process millions of bike-sharing trips and analyze bike-sharing mobility, abstracting relevant mobility flows across specific urban areas. Backed by a visualization platform, this method provides a comprehensive set of analytical tools to support public authorities in making data-driven policy and planning decisions. This paper illustrates the use of the method with a case study of the Greater Boston bike-sharing system and, as a result, presents new findings about that particular system.

The central districts of Beijing consisting of 135 subdistricts are selected as the study area. Massive and spontaneous geo-tagged check-in data released from social media platforms has attracted increasing attentions in urban vibrancy studies because it reflects well people's activities at a certain time, which is a good proxy for urban vibrancy.

Smartization of cities and societies has the potential to unite us, humans, on a sustainable future for us through its focus on the triple bottom line (TBL) – social, environmental, and economic sustainability. Data-driven analytics are at the heart of this smartization. This study provides a case study on sustainable participatory governance using a data-driven parameter discovery for planning online, in-class, and blended learning in Saudi Arabia evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we developed a software tool comprising a complete machine learning pipeline and used a dataset comprising around 2 million tweets in the Arabic language collected during a period of over 14 months (October 2020 to December 2021). We discovered fourteen governance parameters grouped into four governance macro parameters. These discovered parameters by the tool demonstrate the possibility and benefits of our sustainable participatory planning and governance approach, allowing the discovery and grasp of important dimensions of the education sector in Saudi Arabia, the complexity of the policy, the procedural and practical issues in continuing learning during the pandemic, the factors that have contributed to the success of teaching and learning during the pandemic times, both its transition to online learning and its return to in-class learning, the challenges public and government have faced related to learning during the pandemic times, and the new opportunities for social, economical, and environmental benefits that can be drawn out of the situation created by the pandemic. The parameters and information learned through the tool can allow governments to have a participatory approach to governance and improve their policies, procedures, and practices, perpetually through public and stakeholder feedback. The data-driven parameter discovery approach we propose is generic and can be applied to the governance of any sector. The specific case study is used to elaborate on the proposed approach.","['developed', 'new', 'social', 'discovered', 'practical', 'case', 'tweets', 'everything', 'applied', 'inclass', 'drawn', 'allow', 'participatory', 'education', 'million', 'dimensions', 'improve', 'transition', 'economical', 'line', 'global', 'datadriven', 'heart', 'complete', 'cities', 'fourteen', 'proposed', 'months', 'needed', 'policies', 'december', 'possibility', 'software', 'elaborate', 'contributed', 'language', 'faced', 'tool', 'bottom', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'collected', 'complexities', 'success', 'grasp', 'sustainability', 'four', 'dataset', 'tackle', 'economic', 'grouped', 'times', 'blended', 'allowing', 'humans', 'created', 'pandemic', 'propose', 'provides', 'around', 'challenges', 'benefits', 'smartization', 'parameter', 'analytics', 'triple', 'approaches', 'public', 'arabia', 'comprising', 'evidenced', 'important', 'complexity', 'related', 'teaching', 'factors', 'rising', 'us', 'specific', 'feedback', 'demonstrate', 'governments', 'online', 'learning', 'practices', 'machine', 'perpetually', 'return', 'purpose', 'government', 'policy', 'governance', 'arabic', 'continuing', 'stakeholder', 'procedural', 'potential', 'situation', 'unite', 'parameters', 'societies', 'sector', 'environmental', 'issues', 'pipeline', 'macro', 'life', 'tbl', 'focus', 'october', 'period', 'future', 'learned', 'discovery', 'procedures', 'saudi', 'generic', 'opportunities']",2022,"[(1, 0.5625211), (3, 0.43676)]"

Reflections and proposals for combating public corruption in local administration,García A.V.,Revista Espanola de la Transparencia,10.51915/ret.219,4,True,Universidade de Vigo,Vigo,Spain,"In recent years, public administration in Spain has suffered the consequences of public corruption. This problem has been especially relevant in the local sphere. The high atomization of the local level usually implies less demanding control systems with greater incentives for public corruption, especially in urban planning. This reduced size implies a scarcity of resources, both personal, material and technological, and can lead to a lower intensity of the fight against corruption. Based on the above this paper proposes a series of actions to try to reduce public corruption in the local government, including state regulation of lobbies, a statute of protection for bona fide whistleblowers and an appropriate sanctioning regime, and the promotion of open government, with explicit recognition of the right of access to information, separating the sphere of administration from the sphere of government, taking advantage of advances in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in the prevention and correction of fraudulent behaviour within the administration, requiring information from public employees and the creation of regional anti-fraud offices.","['intelligence', 'years', 'separating', 'artificial', 'promotion', 'systems', 'explicit', 'sanctioning', 'public', 'demanding', 'correction', 'taking', 'regime', 'technological', 'high', 'size', 'implies', 'open', 'atomization', 'antifraud', 'material', 'scarcity', 'protection', 'recognition', 'prevention', 'reduced', 'local', 'suffered', 'spain', 'offices', 'reduce', 'lobbies', 'sphere', 'less', 'try', 'actions', 'appropriate', 'corruption', 'regulation', 'right', 'relevant', 'intensity', 'lower', 'personal', 'within', 'government', 'proposes', 'fight', 'advances', 'consequences', 'bona', 'incentives', 'creation', 'whistleblowers', 'advantage', 'state', 'usually', 'access', 'recent', 'problem', 'lead', 'greater', 'fraudulent', 'resources', 'statute', 'level', 'requiring', 'especially', 'fide', 'regional', 'administration', 'including', 'behaviour', 'employees', 'series', 'control']",2022,"[(1, 0.7958966), (2, 0.20292212)]"
Where Are Potential Areas for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)—Exploring the Demands for Built Environment for TOD Planning,Xia J.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su14148364,8,True,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"Sustainable urban growth advocates the implementation of transit-oriented development (TOD) to optimize urban spatial structure. The bilateral planning concept of TOD emphasizes the importance of discovering areas with existing TOD features but poor public transit service (potential TOD areas) and further introducing transit connectivity or conducting TOD policy in such areas to facilitate sustainable transportation. However, current studies that are devoted to discovering potential TOD areas remain scarce. In this study, we find that random forest (RF) is an optimal algorithm that can effectively identify potential TOD regions in Hong Kong. We propose an RF-mediated machine learning model (RF-TPI model) and reveal underlying mechanisms of specific indicators. After iteratively learning the typical features of TOD areas in Hong Kong, the developed RF-TPI model shows great capacity to identify potential TOD areas, with satisfactory model performances (accuracy score: 0.89, precision score: 0.81). Further investigation on manifestations of indicators by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) interpreter demonstrates the intricate, significant nonlinear and threshold effects of distinct indicators. Conclusively, we highlight that random forest would be a prospective tool for identifying potential TOD areas to aid TOD strategy in urban sustainable endeavors.","['developed', 'tod', 'existing', 'structure', 'scarce', 'distinct', 'would', 'prospective', 'bilateral', 'hong', 'service', 'discovering', 'demonstrates', 'connectivity', 'identifying', 'kong', 'remain', 'regions', 'tool', 'sustainable', 'rfmediated', 'endeavors', 'significant', 'effectively', 'find', 'rf', 'interpreter', 'shows', 'areas', 'manifestations', 'emphasizes', 'implementation', 'propose', 'underlying', 'strategy', 'conducting', 'nonlinear', 'highlight', 'growth', 'precision', 'typical', 'advocates', 'public', 'great', 'importance', 'studies', 'indicators', 'forest', 'transportation', 'specific', 'learning', 'aid', 'random', 'machine', 'effects', 'score', 'iteratively', 'policy', 'introducing', 'optimal', 'investigation', 'potential', 'performances', 'facilitate', 'concept', 'features', 'optimize', 'shap', 'algorithm', 'conclusively', 'capacity', 'shapley', 'identify', 'mechanisms', 'satisfactory', 'current', 'additive', 'explanations', 'intricate', 'accuracy', 'transitoriented', 'rftpi', 'poor', 'reveal', 'transit', 'devoted', 'threshold']",2022,"[(1, 0.99840903)]"
"Revealing Taxi Interaction Network of Urban Functional Area Units in Shenzhen, China",Lai G.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi11070377,6,True,Guangzhou University,Guangzhou,China,"Characterizing the taxi travel network is of fundamental importance to our understanding of urban mobility, and could provide intellectual support for urban planning, traffic congestion, and even the spread of diseases. However, the research on the interaction network between urban functional area (UFA) units are limited and worthy of notice. Therefore, this study has applied the taxi big data to construct a travel flow network for the exploration of spatial interaction relationships between different UFA units in Shenzhen, China. Our results suggested that taxi travel behavior was more active in UFA units dominated by functions, including residential, commercial, scenic, and greenspace during weekends, while more active in UFA units dominated by industrial function during weekdays. In terms of daily average volume, the characteristics of spatial interaction between the various UFA types during weekdays and weekends were similar. During the morning peak period, the sink areas were mainly distributed in Futian District and Nanshan District, while during the evening peak period, the sink areas were mainly distributed in the southern part of Yantian District, the southwestern part of Longgang District, and the eastern part of Luohu District. The average daily taxi mobility network during weekdays showed a spatial pattern of “dense in the west and north, sparse in the south and east”, exhibiting significant spatial unevenness. Compared with weekdays, the daily taxi mobility network during weekends was more dispersed and the differences in node sizes decreased, indicating that taxi travel destinations were more diverse. The pattern of communities was more consistent with the administrative division during weekdays, indicating that taxi trips are predominantly within the districts. Compared with weekdays, the community pattern of network during weekends was clearly different and more in line with the characteristics of a small world network. The findings can provide a better understanding of urban mobility characteristics in Shenzhen, and provide a reference for urban transportation planning and management.","['community', 'decreased', 'management', 'predominantly', 'applied', 'sizes', 'district', 'eastern', 'relationships', 'various', 'division', 'therefore', 'line', 'limited', 'sparse', 'traffic', 'diseases', 'scenic', 'active', 'yantian', 'intellectual', 'destinations', 'congestion', 'weekdays', 'similar', 'longgang', 'south', 'morning', 'including', 'even', 'peak', 'administrative', 'communities', 'dispersed', 'significant', 'spread', 'part', 'fundamental', 'distributed', 'provide', 'west', 'ufa', 'southern', 'exploration', 'sink', 'notice', 'could', 'network', 'showed', 'reference', 'evening', 'futian', 'areas', 'world', 'residential', 'clearly', 'terms', 'average', 'better', 'types', 'trips', 'weekends', 'interaction', 'dominated', 'behavior', 'importance', 'mainly', 'construct', 'compared', 'southwestern', 'dense', 'transportation', 'taxi', 'function', 'unevenness', 'east', 'within', 'travel', 'shenzhen', 'small', 'commercial', 'characterizing', 'daily', 'worthy', 'node', 'luohu', 'area', 'mobility', 'suggested', 'functions', 'flow', 'indicating', 'greenspace', 'industrial', 'functional', 'volume', 'characteristics', 'consistent', 'nanshan', 'pattern', 'different', 'diverse', 'support', 'period', 'districts', 'exhibiting', 'differences', 'units', 'north']",2022,"[(1, 0.9987297)]"

There is ample evidence that built environment characteristics are associated with urban vibrancy; however, the spatiotemporal associations between built environment and urban vibrancy have not been fully investigated owing to the inherent limitations of traditional data. To address this gap, we measured spatiotemporal urban vibrancy in Shenzhen, China, using Tencent location-based big data, which is characterized by fine-grained population-level spatiotemporal granularity. Built environment characteristics were systematically measured using the 5D framework (density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance to transit) with multi-source datasets. We investigated the spatiotemporal non-stationary associations using a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. The results indicated that the GTWR models achieved better goodness-of-fit than linear regression models. Built environment factors such as population density; point of interest (POI) mix; residential, commercial, company, and public service POI; and metro station were significantly associated with urban vibrancy. Time series clustering revealed spatiotemporal clustered patterns of the associations between built environment factors and urban vibrancy. To promote urban vibrancy with urban planning and design strategies, both the spatial and temporal associations between the built environment and urban vibrancy should be considered.","['models', 'patterns', 'human', 'owing', 'promoting', 'time', 'various', 'associated', 'investigated', 'revealed', 'considered', 'systematically', 'objectives', 'datasets', 'service', 'traditional', 'mix', 'clustering', 'granularity', 'linear', 'temporal', 'series', 'goodnessoffit', 'multisource', 'population', 'destination', 'populationlevel', 'major', 'limitations', 'accessibility', 'characterized', 'metro', 'residential', 'indicated', 'benefits', 'better', 'achieved', 'nonstationary', 'finegrained', 'measured', 'public', 'associations', 'gtwr', 'regression', 'one', 'geographically', 'diversity', 'tencent', 'strategies', 'factors', 'clustered', 'gap', 'station', 'planners', 'built', 'fully', 'significantly', 'weighted', 'shenzhen', 'commercial', 'point', 'government', 'locationbased', 'interest', 'address', 'linked', 'officials', 'density', 'characteristics', 'inherent', 'temporally', 'ample', 'spatiotemporal', 'prosperity', 'distance', 'poi', 'company', 'environment', 'transit', 'promote', 'wellbeing', 'vibrancy']",2022,"[(1, 0.998313)]"
Understanding the impact of the built environment on ride-hailing from a spatio-temporal perspective: A fine-scale empirical study from China,Zheng Z.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103706,20,False,Henan University,Kaifeng,China,"The explosive growth of ride-hailing as a new mode of transportation worldwide has attracted great attention from both academic and planning communities. Ride-hailing services have induced profound changes in residential travel patterns. However, the mechanisms and spatio-temporal roles of the influence the built environment imposes on ride-hailing services remain unclear. Based on ride-hailing GPS data and Web map big data, in this study, spatio-temporal entropy indicators of ride-hailing travel behavior and fine-scaled built environment indicators are constructed. Based on these, global and local regression models are developed to explore the spatio-temporal impact mechanisms of various built environments and socio-economic factors on ride-hailing travel in Chengdu, China. A strong correlation is found between various types of built environment and the spatio-temporal entropy of ride-hailing travel. Specifically, whether working on weekdays or weekends, building density and education facilities impose a significant inhibitory effect on ride-hailing spatio-temporal entropy, while mixed land use, house prices, catering, corporate businesses, lifestyle facilities, tourist attractions, and distance to transit significantly increase ride-hailing spatio-temporal entropy. In addition, the uncertain geographic context and the differences in residents' activities on different days of the week cause significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the impact the built environment has on ride-hailing spatio-temporal entropy. Noteworthy, mixed land use exerts the strongest promoting effect on ride-hailing and a positive effect on ride-hailing pick-ups and drop-offs in the whole region. The intensity of this effect tends to decay gradually from the urban center to the periphery. Furthermore, ride-hailing can both substitute for and complement public transport. More interestingly, the study also found an “olive-shaped” social structure between the socio-economic level and the demand for ride-hailing. This study thus not only enriches the theory of spatial behavior within the context of the new era, the results also help planners to reduce car travel dependence by optimizing the built environment.

Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works.

(3) Langfang, Tangshan, Tianjin, and Baoding, which are located in the center of BTH region, act as ""middlemen"" in the redistribution process of the relieving policy. They become main cities to drive functional interaction. (4) Shijiazhuang mainly received the functional zones from Tianjin and Langfang, which shows the relay characteristics. (5) The government's decision-making for redistribution of urban functional zones in the BTH region should consider the evolution trend of functional interaction patterns among cities so as to take targeted governance measures. Our findings indicate that the urban functional interactive model could better explain and reveal changing characteristics of the functional interaction patterns in the study region.","['become', 'patterns', 'mixed', 'depict', 'coupled', 'new', 'evolution', 'beijingtianjinhebei', 'analyze', 'decisionmaking', 'hot', 'dimensions', 'periods', 'time', 'dispersing', 'act', 'measures', 'zone', 'cities', 'niche', 'datasets', 'tianjin', 'received', 'service', 'redistribution', 'located', 'revised', 'changing', 'takes', 'meanwhile', 'trend', 'three', 'bth', 'beijing', 'problems', 'apply', 'langfang', 'scientific', 'ecological', 'principle', 'interactive', 'supported', 'could', 'baoding', 'times', 'noncapital', 'relay', 'shows', 'space', 'areas', 'implementation', 'fastestgrowing', 'residential', 'take', 'steadily', 'better', 'shijiazhuang', 'interaction', 'suggestions', 'come', 'decade', 'public', 'important', 'academia', 'one', 'mainly', 'strategies', 'commonly', 'center', 'coordinated', 'past', 'governments', 'main', 'educational', 'introduced', 'still', 'agglomeration', 'land', 'increased', 'total', 'topics', 'commercial', 'government', 'distribution', 'policy', 'aggregated', 'governance', 'zones', 'uses', 'consider', 'middlemen', 'gravity', 'area', 'targeted', 'shiftshare', 'functions', 'industrial', 'gis', 'functional', 'characteristics', 'relieving', 'explain', 'region', 'evaluate', 'identify', 'cultural', 'aspect', 'expanding', 'technique', 'current', 'indicate', 'among', 'poi', 'reveal', 'tangshan', 'drive']",2022,"[(1, 0.998806)]"

Uncovering the shape of neighborhoods: Harnessing data analytics for a smart governance of urban areas,Sagi A.,Journal of Urban Management,10.1016/j.jum.2022.05.005,4,True,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Haifa,Israel,"Urban scholars have made great advances to understand the reciprocal relations between households and their immediate environments as a means for the creation of efficient urban administrative systems. However, from an urban management perspective, reliance on geographical areas fixed for long periods of time as basic data collection constitutes a problem. Modern urban areas are in a permanent state of flux because of changing preferences, willingness to pay, location choices, and physical development. In this constantly changing context, what is the most appropriate delimitation of a “neighborhood”, defined as a small and relatively homogeneous area in a certain (and temporary) urban configuration? This paper contributes to the growing literature on the use of data analytic tools in urban studies and neighborhood delimitation in housing sub-markets, exploiting big data on real-estate transactions in England and Wales during a long period of time. The results shed light on the importance of organic urban features and the drawbacks of rigid geometric definitions. They also highlight the importance of the usage of deep Machine Learning (ML) tools such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), alongside with traditional methods. The paper's contribution to urban governance is the suggestion of a smart and dynamic system aimed at defining the most appropriate areas for urban management given a specific period and situation. The suggested framework can be implemented periodically, helping to define homogeneous spatial units (neighborhoods) with large variances among them, allowing for designing urban policies tailored to each one of them.","['households', 'ann', 'management', 'systems', 'large', 'use', 'homogeneous', 'periodically', 'periods', 'time', 'geographical', 'modern', 'literature', 'transactions', 'reciprocal', 'immediate', 'preferences', 'smart', 'flux', 'deep', 'willingness', 'variances', 'contribution', 'definitions', 'neighborhoods', 'traditional', 'policies', 'changing', 'ml', 'administrative', 'artificial', 'location', 'drawbacks', 'pay', 'permanent', 'rigid', 'dynamic', 'made', 'neural', 'exploiting', 'choices', 'understand', 'network', 'geometric', 'england', 'defining', 'usage', 'suggestion', 'allowing', 'organic', 'scholars', 'advances', 'contributes', 'papers', 'long', 'areas', 'housing', 'collection', 'problem', 'means', 'highlight', 'perspective', 'great', 'analytic', 'fixed', 'shed', 'constantly', 'importance', 'one', 'studies', 'reliance', 'growing', 'constitutes', 'specific', 'alongside', 'tailored', 'learning', 'light', 'aimed', 'small', 'realestate', 'machine', 'helping', 'context', 'certain', 'submarkets', 'governance', 'designing', 'given', 'area', 'relatively', 'situation', 'suggested', 'environments', 'configuration', 'physical', 'features', 'neighborhood', 'delimitation', 'temporary', 'implemented', 'basic', 'relations', 'appropriate', 'efficient', 'wales', 'period', 'creation', 'define', 'system', 'state', 'defined', 'among', 'tools', 'units']",2022,"[(3, 0.99847454)]"
Gender Disparities in green exposure: An empirical study in suburban Beijing,Wu J.,Landscape and Urban Planning,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104381,20,False,"College of Agriculture &amp; Biotechnology, Zhejiang University",Hangzhou,China,"Good urban green space is conducive to the physical and mental health of residents. However, the exposure of different social groups to urban greenness is not always equal. The majority of literature used residential areas as the analysis unit to evaluate green space, which may lead to biased estimates because it ignores daily mobility. In addition, many studies discussed gender as a variable rather than the main focus. In this context, the present research attempted to develop and explore a broad analytical theme, namely, examine whether green exposure between genders is equal. We used 7,880 GPS trip tracking data from 662 respondents in Haidian District, Beijing, and combined these with street view big data and machine learning to calculate the green view index for constructing a novel method of measuring green exposure. The results provided three main insights: (1) Men enjoyed greater overall green exposure than women because they are generally less restricted when traveling. (2) Women are more likely to choose green, pleasant, and safe travel routes than men. Thus, they experience higher levels of green exposure of unit travel distance. (3) Individual and travel characteristics result in different green exposure, and different travel modes may enhance or weaken men and women's exposure to green spaces in different ways.

Urban commons in the techno-economic paradigm shift: An information and communication technology-enabled climate-resilient solutions review,Chien H.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/23998083211066324,8,True,"United Nations University, Japan",Tokyo,Japan,"The commons concept has evolved in multiple ways after the publication of Ostrom’s seminal work in 1990, which emphasized the evolution of resource management institutions and the usefulness of self-governance. As we move into the 21st century, one of the institutional transformations is catalyzed by the emergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a techno-economic paradigm shift and the epochal creation of a new online social structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of ICT on common resource management, particularly in urban settings, that is urban commons. This study presents a systematic literature review of ICT-enabled urban commons with particular attention to its application to climate-related issues such as climate mitigation/adaptation in order to improve our collective ability to leverage ICT for building a more sustainable and resilient city. A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT.

Understanding Housing Prices Using Geographic Big Data: A Case Study in Shenzhen,Jiang X.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su14095307,6,True,Aerospace Information Research Institute,Beijing,China,"Understanding the spatial pattern of urban house prices and its association with the built environment is of great significance to housing policymaking and urban planning. However, many studies on the influencing factors of urban housing prices conduct qualitative analyses using statistical data and manual survey data. In addition, traditional housing price models are mostly linear models that cannot explain the distribution of housing prices in urban areas. In this paper, we propose using geographic big data and zonal nonlinear feature machine learning models to understand housing prices. First, the housing price influencing factor system is built based on the hedonic pricing model and geographic big data, and it includes commercial development, transportation, infrastructure, location, education, environment, and residents’ consumption level. Second, a spatial exploratory analysis framework for house price data was constructed using Moran’s I tools and geographic detectors. Finally, the XGBoost model is developed to assess the importance of the variables influencing housing prices, and the zonal nonlinear feature model is built to predict housing prices based on spatial exploration results. Taking Shenzhen as an example, this paper explored the distribution law of housing prices, analyzed the influencing factors of housing prices, and compared the different housing price models.

With street view imagery (SVI), points of interest (POI) and comment data from social media, this study evaluates street space quality from the perspective of exploring and discussing the relationship among street vitality, service facilities and built environment. Firstly, a transfer-learning-based framework is employed for SVI semantic segmentation to quantify the street built environment. Then, we use POI data to identify different urban functions that streets serve, and comment data are utilized to investigate urban vitality composition and integrate it with different urban functions associated with streets. Finally, a function-driven street space quality assessment approach is established. To examine its applicability and performance, the proposed method is experimented with data from part area in Xiamen, China.

We model the effects of the socio-economic, built environment, climate, and spatial/accessibility factors on park visitations through a fixed effects regression. Results show variations among park service areas. Water bodies and playgrounds are significant factors enhancing park visitations while walking paths, sports facilities, and pavilions are not. Contrary to previous research, high-income block groups show lower participation in park activities. The study also reveals how smartphone mobility data can be applied to case studies investigating urban design/planning and understanding of the social aspects associated with urban greenspaces.

Spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms of street vending from the social sensing perspective: A comparison between law-enforcement reported and residents complain events,Li C.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103597,9,False,Peking University,Beijing,China,"Street vending is an important part of the urban informal economy, especially in developing countries. How to control its negative externalities while augmenting its positive roles in the urban socio-economic system poses challenges to urban planning and governance.

By introducing socially sensed big data from the smart urban governance platform, as well as records from the “12345” urban problem complaint hotline of Jiangbei District, Ningbo, China, this paper examines and compares the spatiotemporal patterns and occurrence mechanisms of street vending events from both the urban managers' “top-down” and the urban residents' “bottom-up” points of view. Statistical and machine learning models show that the distribution of street vending activities as sensed by the two subjects does not overlap. The former concentrates in central urban areas and work times, while the latter is scattered distributed in everyday life-related places and times.

Review of Territorial Space Use Zoning Based on CiteSpace,Zhu P.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003473,0,False,Hunan Key Laboratory of Land Resources Evaluation and Utilization,Changsha,China,"The paper reviews the current focus and future direction of China's research in the field of territorial space use zoning and aims to provide a scientific basis for China's spatial planning and territorial and spatial land management with the wider goal of improving the system of ecological civilization to promote the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacities. We use CiteSpace, a visualization software and method of bibliometric analysis, to create a knowledge map and systematically categorize the research trends and development context of territorial space use zoning research, based on 662 relevant papers published from 1979 to 2020 and cited on HowNet. Research on territorial space use zoning in China continues to emerge, and the number of published papers is increasing. The research was divided into three stages: the land use zoning stage (1992-2006), the natural ecological space use zoning stage (2007-2017), and the territorial space use zoning stage (2018-present). The main research keywords in the three periods show that scholars have consistently maintained an enthusiasm for the study of ""land use"". The keyword ""land use"" had a high centrality of 0.28. Close cooperation among authors formed a large-scale scientific research cluster. Colleges and universities published the most, followed by scientific research institutions and public institutions; the main outputs of public institutions such as China Land Surveying and Planning Institute are policy documents, the influence of which should not be underestimated. 2) The research on territorial space use zoning was national policy-oriented under the profound influence of the changing background of the times. Zoning theory developed from the theory of geographical differentiation and advantageous location into the concept of main functional zone regulation, and then to the present concept of sustainable development. Zoning systems were constantly optimized, and research focuses were diverse. Some provinces and cities conducted practical explorations based on local conditions because of ""Three zones and three lines"". ""Three zones and three lines"" refers to the areas corresponding to the three types of urban space, agricultural space, and ecological space, and the three control lines corresponding to the urban development boundary, the permanent basic farmland protection red line, and the ecological protection red line. In the face of the complexity and dynamics of territorial space, research methods have changed from qualitative or quantitative methods to focus on the application of modern science and technology. Most of the research on zoning control focuses on three aspects: discovery of existing problems, enlightenment from foreign experience, and research on zoning practice. Considering the existing problems, such as conventional research contents, shallow scientific validation studies, insufficient theoretical improvements, few applications of multidisciplinary integration and big data, future researches should focus on four directions as follows: carrying out the theoretical research related to territorial space use zoning; deepening use zoning research on ecological space, marine space and rural construction space; broadening the research perspective of territorial space use zoning based on the construction needs of territorial space use control system; implementing innovative methods and technologies for application based on multidisciplinary integration.","['goal', 'institutions', 'enthusiasm', 'management', 'developed', 'number', 'systems', 'existing', 'practical', 'use', 'emerge', 'method', 'high', 'wider', 'aims', 'theoretical', 'stages', 'integration', 'periods', 'broadening', 'natural', 'considering', 'conventional', 'map', 'geographical', 'line', 'modern', 'consistently', 'zoning', 'enlightenment', 'universities', 'relevant', 'conditions', 'zone', 'cities', 'systematically', 'corresponding', 'institute', 'modernization', 'present', 'colleges', 'carrying', 'cooperation', 'changing', 'software', 'innovative', 'cluster', 'quantitative', 'capacities', 'profound', 'location', 'sustainable', 'three', 'refers', 'problems', 'differentiation', 'stage', 'improvements', 'aspects', 'permanent', 'technology', 'four', 'provinces', 'scientific', 'provide', 'ecological', 'follows', 'experience', 'times', 'directions', 'basis', 'scholars', 'papers', 'contents', 'space', 'areas', 'civilization', 'foreign', 'types', 'optimized', 'show', 'insufficient', 'largescale', 'perspective', 'chinas', 'surveying', 'cited', 'public', 'complexity', 'constantly', 'related', 'technologies', 'studies', 'national', 'protection', 'keyword', 'reviews', 'categorize', 'face', 'local', 'lines', 'visualization', 'advantageous', 'multidisciplinary', 'main', 'authors', 'create', 'maintained', 'centrality', 'boundary', 'hownet', 'practice', 'land', 'science', 'needs', 'increasing', 'outputs', 'explorations', 'followed', 'close', 'context', 'control', 'influence', 'background', 'dynamics', 'direction', 'policy', 'underestimated', 'governance', 'conducted', 'rural', 'zones', 'formed', 'applications', 'construction', 'keywords', 'concept', 'functional', 'farmland', 'shallow', 'territorial', 'red', 'divided', 'basic', 'improving', 'focus', 'field', 'continues', 'implementing', 'diverse', 'documents', 'deepening', 'marine', 'current', 'bibliometric', 'future', 'published', 'system', 'among', 'changed', 'focuses', 'agricultural', 'discovery', 'validation', 'trends', 'qualitative', 'researches', 'promote', 'citespace', 'policyoriented', 'regulation']",2022,"[(1, 0.111900605), (3, 0.8876035)]"
Urban Smart Public Transport Studies: A Review and Prospect,Xu M.,Jiaotong Yunshu Xitong Gongcheng Yu Xinxi/Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology,10.16097/j.cnki.1009-6744.2022.02.009,13,False,Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing,China,"Based on the recent development of urban smart public transport and its status in China, this study systematically reviews four crucial research areas, including the analysis of passenger flow characteristics, operations management, network design and optimization, and system evaluation. The limitations of existing researches and future research directions in the four areas are discussed. Correspondingly, this study examines the emerging trends of urban smart public transport from four aspects: intelligent recognition and prediction of passenger flow characteristics, urban smart public transport operations in complex scenarios, urban smart public transport network design and optimization, and urban smart public transport service evaluation. The primary research questions associated with each aspect are proposed. Particularly, this paper identifies the following four urgent research topics, including (i) mining passengers' complete travel chain information and providing integrated urban smart public transport travel services; (ii) integrating and optimizing public transport infrastructure layout and operational efficiency from the perspective of land use and transportation integration; (iii) building a three-dimensional bus operation and evaluation system from the perspectives of the government, enterprises, and users, based on their multi-level development needs; and (iv) building an integrated urban smart public transport travel service platform. Furthermore, in viewing the current development of urban smart public transport, this paper summarizes its current status and points out the shortcomings of existing research and critical scientific issues. It is revealed that integrated applications of emerging and disruptive technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, autonomous driving, intelligent, connected, and new energy vehicles, offered new opportunities and challenges in providing multimodal urban smart transport services and promoting sustainable urban development. However, new technologies will not spontaneously improve public transport services and accelerate sustainable urban development. Finally, this study emphasizes that future research needs to strengthen the multi-disciplinary intersection, highlight the combination of industry, university, and research, and provide strong scientific support for the high-quality development of urban smart urban public transport in China.","['mining', 'management', 'points', 'new', 'existing', 'use', 'questions', 'integration', 'bus', 'promoting', 'improve', 'users', 'providing', 'efficiency', 'associated', 'shortcomings', 'perspectives', 'smart', 'revealed', 'complete', 'correspondingly', 'systematically', 'finally', 'proposed', 'optimizing', 'service', 'ii', 'following', 'urgent', 'recent', 'including', 'multimodal', 'examines', 'scenarios', 'driving', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'strengthen', 'aspects', 'four', 'scientific', 'provide', 'limitations', 'offered', 'combination', 'multilevel', 'network', 'disruptive', 'directions', 'university', 'areas', 'integrated', 'emphasizes', 'transport', 'vehicles', 'operation', 'intersection', 'challenges', 'strong', 'iv', 'layout', 'highlight', 'computing', 'perspective', 'operational', 'public', 'highquality', 'iii', 'technologies', 'reviews', 'transportation', 'enterprises', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimization', 'travel', 'spontaneously', 'emerging', 'particularly', 'land', 'needs', 'primary', 'threedimensional', 'industry', 'energy', 'crucial', 'topics', 'intelligent', 'infrastructure', 'status', 'government', 'platform', 'summarizes', 'passengers', 'furthermore', 'prediction', 'cloud', 'applications', 'accelerate', 'flow', 'discussed', 'recognition', 'connected', 'operations', 'issues', 'characteristics', 'building', 'critical', 'autonomous', 'passenger', 'aspect', 'support', 'identifies', 'current', 'integrating', 'future', 'viewing', 'system', 'services', 'trends', 'chain', 'researches', 'opportunities']",2022,"[(1, 0.1001447), (2, 0.8991196)]"
Quantification of Spatial Association between Commercial and Residential Spaces in Beijing Using Urban Big Data,Zhou L.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi11040249,7,True,Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications,Nanjing,China,"Commercial and residential spaces are two core types of geographical objects in urban areas. However, these two types of spaces are not independent of each other. Spatial associations exist between them, and a thorough understanding of this spatial association is of great significance for improving the efficiency of urban spatial allocation and realizing scientific spatial planning and governance. Thus, in this paper, the spatial association between commercial and residential spaces in Beijing is quantified with GIS spatial analysis of the average nearest neighbor distance, kernel density, spatial correlation, and honeycomb grid analysis. Point-of-interest (POI) big data of the commercial and residential spaces is used in the quantification since this big data represents a comprehensive sampling of these two spaces. The results show that the spatial distributions of commercial and residential spaces are highly correlated, maintaining a relatively close consumption spatial association. However, the degrees of association between different commercial formats and residential spaces vary, presenting the spatial association characteristics of “integration of daily consumption and separation of nondaily consumption”. The commercial formats of catering services, recreation and leisure services, specialty stores, and agricultural markets are strongly associated with the residential spaces. However, the development of frequently used commercial formats of daily consumption such as living services, convenience stores, and supermarkets appears to lag behind the development of residential spaces. In addition, large-scale comprehensive and specialized commercial formats such as shopping malls, home appliances and electronics stores, and home building materials markets are lagging behind the residential spaces over a wide range. This paper is expected to provide development suggestions for the transformation of urban commercial and residential spaces and the construction of “people-oriented” smart cities.","['electronics', 'strongly', 'lag', 'consumption', 'vary', 'integration', 'efficiency', 'geographical', 'associated', 'expected', 'peopleoriented', 'smart', 'cities', 'sampling', 'correlation', 'core', 'lagging', 'grid', 'two', 'specialized', 'distributions', 'range', 'since', 'wide', 'beijing', 'appliances', 'highly', 'scientific', 'provide', 'specialty', 'addition', 'areas', 'formats', 'residential', 'average', 'supermarkets', 'transformation', 'types', 'catering', 'allocation', 'appears', 'independent', 'show', 'suggestions', 'largescale', 'frequently', 'great', 'associations', 'convenience', 'nearest', 'neighbor', 'markets', 'leisure', 'kernel', 'association', 'shopping', 'represents', 'materials', 'separation', 'maintaining', 'spaces', 'close', 'commercial', 'living', 'objects', 'daily', 'quantification', 'governance', 'comprehensive', 'behind', 'relatively', 'construction', 'density', 'gis', 'exist', 'characteristics', 'home', 'improving', 'building', 'stores', 'thorough', 'honeycomb', 'realizing', 'pointofinterest', 'different', 'presenting', 'quantified', 'significance', 'thus', 'malls', 'distance', 'agricultural', 'poi', 'services', 'degrees', 'correlated', 'recreation', 'nondaily']",2022,"[(0, 0.6629319), (1, 0.33602312)]"

However, little attention is paid to the connection between the digital transition and sustainability. Thus, a systematic bibliometric literature review was developed to fill this knowledge gap and demonstrate the potential contributions of the digital transition to environmental, economic, and social sustainability aspects. In environmental sustain-ability, the digital transition involves the application of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile technologies that are used to develop and implement sustainability solutions in areas such as sustainable urban development, sustainable production, and pollution control. In economic sustainability, emerging digital technologies can drive transformation into a more sustainable circular economy, the digital sharing economy, and establish sustainable manufacturing and infrastructure design.

Government responsiveness and public acceptance of big-data technology in urban governance: Evidence from China during the COVID-19 pandemic,Guo Y.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103536,33,False,Beijing Normal University,Beijing,China,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to nations and cities worldwide. Governments have adopted Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to rapidly control the spread of a novel coronavirus. As an innovative but controversial ICT-based tool, health QR code plays a vital role by assisting rapid contact tracing. Yet, whether and how citizens accept this policy tool remains an unknown theoretical and empirical question. In this paper, we study the sources that determine citizens' acceptance of health QR code in city governance. Based on a nation-wide online survey covering 28 major provincial-capital cities in China, we find that individual experiences and political identities affect citizens' acceptance of QR code. Even though public opinion regarding this issue is diverse, the government's responses to citizens' requests play a critical role in enhancing their acceptance of using QR code both in the current and future stages. Specifically, as the citizens perceive a higher level of city government responsiveness, they are less worried about privacy leaks and more likely to perceive the effectiveness of health QR code in improving public health, thus resulting in a higher acceptance.

Measurement and Evaluation of the Coordinated Development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,Wang C.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003434,9,False,Guangdong Academy of Sciences,Guangzhou,China,"On the basis of fully understanding the scientific connotation of coordinated development of urban agglomeration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the evaluation index system of coordinated development is constructed from four dimensions: industrial coordinative innovation, environmental coordinative governance, service coordinative sharing and institutional coordinative arrangement. The theory and method of space of flows, big data, network analysis and interlocking network model are comprehensively used to quantitatively analyze the interurban relationship, liquidity, connectivity and boundary effect. The research shows that: 1) Interurban capital flow is concentrated between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and interurban knowledge flow is concentrated among Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Macao, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen have higher level of collaborative environmental governance, while Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou and Guangzhou-Foshan have lower level of collaborative environmental governance. The interurban service coordination sharing level of infrastructure such as transportation, communications, logistics and banking is higher among cities of Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Foshan and Shenzhen-Dongguan. And Hong Kong and Macao have institutional advantages in cross-border regional coordination. 2) Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Foshan, Shenzhen and Dongguan, and Hong Kong and Shenzhen have the best level of coordinated development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. At the same time, Guangzhou and Dongguan, Shenzhen and Foshan show a linkage trend. Although the de-boundary trend is obvious and the interurban liquidity is enhanced, the coordinated development level of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is generally not high. 3) The collaborative capacity of Guangzhou and Shenzhen is the strongest, and there is still much room for improvement in the collaborative capacity of the two international cities, Hong Kong and Macao.

Nevertheless, the oversimplification and inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy, inherited in the UHI concept, is increasingly manifest today in the continuously urbanized world. In this study, we conduct a holistic and in-depth survey of the inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy intrinsic to the definition of UHI, from theoretical, technical, and practical perspectives. In addition, in the light of recent research advances, we urge to radically reconceptualize UHI by proposing a novel paradigm by treating the total urban environment as a complex dynamic system. The new framework broadens the frontier of conventional urban environmental study by utilizing advanced techniques of complex systems and data sciences, including complex network theory, machine learning techniques, causal inference, etc. The reconceptualization of UHI is also expected to foster decision making and urban planning, and to avoid the one-sidedness of the singular and often too exclusive aim of heat mitigation.","['community', 'avoid', 'new', 'systems', 'promoted', 'practical', 'inference', 'decades', 'theoretical', 'sciences', 'making', 'conventional', 'inherited', 'expected', 'frontier', 'heat', 'simplicity', 'convenient', 'treating', 'manifest', 'perspectives', 'nevertheless', 'recent', 'oversimplification', 'including', 'complex', 'phenomenon', 'significant', 'increasingly', 'dynamic', 'inadequacy', 'causal', 'onesidedness', 'scientific', 'processes', 'broadens', 'network', 'singular', 'urbanized', 'advances', 'addition', 'mitigation', 'novel', 'world', 'intrinsic', 'seen', 'urbanrural', 'exclusive', 'holistic', 'urge', 'uhi', 'continuously', 'foster', 'survey', 'despite', 'advanced', 'drastically', 'effort', 'past', 'paradigm', 'today', 'learning', 'light', 'conduct', 'dichotomy', 'increasing', 'total', 'machine', 'techniques', 'policy', 'technical', 'aim', 'island', 'reconceptualization', 'indepth', 'progress', 'environmental', 'concept', 'reconceptualize', 'utilizing', 'definition', 'system', 'proposing', 'radically', 'environment', 'often', 'decision', 'etc']",2022,"[(2, 0.99795043)]"
Citizens and cities: Leveraging citizen science and big data for sustainable urban development,Cappa F.,Business Strategy and the Environment,10.1002/bse.2942,60,True,LUISS University,Rome,Italy,"Citizen science (CS), that is, the involvement of citizens in data collection or analysis for research projects, is becoming more widespread. This is due to the increasing digitalization of the general public and due to the increasing number of grand challenges that society is facing. Thanks to the contributions of common citizens in data collection and data analysis conducted through technology-mediated interactions, CS can produce a number of benefits for researchers, public organizations, policymakers, citizens, and society as a whole. Given the high density of socio-economic activities in cities, CS can be implemented in a particularly effective way in urban environments to help tackle many “grand challenges”, namely, the pressing environmental and social issues that societies are facing at present. However, CS still has untapped potential to be explored. Indeed, we contend that even though CS involves citizens for precisely defined scientific objectives, the interaction that occurs can also be leveraged to collect data beyond the original aim, thereby producing big data (BD). Through a multiple case studies analysis, we highlight how CS can be used to collect BD as well, which can be a valuable resource for researchers, public organizations, and policymakers. With this aim in mind, this study proposes the definition of a citizen-sourcing framework that jointly employs CS and BD, and it highlights which processes can be implemented to favor the sustainable development of urban environments. Moreover, we also discuss the looming dangers associated with citizen-sourcing as a result of technology-mediated interactions and the use of digital technologies, and we highlight possible future developments.","['facing', 'untapped', 'social', 'number', 'case', 'common', 'use', 'result', 'high', 'well', 'indeed', 'widespread', 'associated', 'policymakers', 'cities', 'society', 'objectives', 'present', 'explored', 'grand', 'mind', 'bd', 'even', 'producing', 'interactions', 'sustainable', 'effective', 'way', 'looming', 'citizens', 'scientific', 'due', 'tackle', 'processes', 'becoming', 'general', 'contend', 'highlights', 'citizen', 'original', 'contributions', 'precisely', 'thanks', 'collection', 'multiple', 'developments', 'challenges', 'benefits', 'collect', 'whole', 'jointly', 'highlight', 'technologymediated', 'interaction', 'public', 'digital', 'employs', 'technologies', 'studies', 'organizations', 'pressing', 'dangers', 'cs', 'socioeconomic', 'produce', 'leveraged', 'proposes', 'discuss', 'beyond', 'particularly', 'still', 'activities', 'involvement', 'science', 'increasing', 'favor', 'conducted', 'resource', 'aim', 'given', 'help', 'potential', 'societies', 'environments', 'density', 'environmental', 'issues', 'implemented', 'valuable', 'projects', 'digitalization', 'researchers', 'definition', 'possible', 'involves', 'citizensourcing', 'future', 'defined', 'moreover', 'though', 'occurs', 'many', 'namely', 'thereby']",2022,"[(3, 0.99831396)]"
Monitoring and Understanding Urban Transformation: A Mixed Method Approach,Bannan T.J.,Frontiers in Sustainable Cities,10.3389/frsc.2021.787484,6,True,The University of Manchester,Manchester,United Kingdom,"Cities must address many challenges including air quality, climate change and the health and wellbeing of communities. Public authorities and developers increasingly look to improve these through the implementation of interventions and innovations, such as low traffic neighbourhoods, deep housing retrofits and green infrastructure. Monitoring the impacts of interventions is essential to determine the success of such projects and to build evidence for broader urban transformation. In this paper we present a mixed-method cross-disciplinary approach that brings together cutting edge atmospheric and data science, measurements of activity in public spaces and novel methods to assess wellbeing-promoting behaviours. The Manchester Urban Observatory focuses on living areas that have a high density of inter-related systems, which require observation, understanding and intervention at multiple levels. This must be completed in line with urban planning goals as well as a clear and succinct data solution that allows robust scientific conclusions to be made and viewed in real time. Delivery of such a monitoring strategy is not trivial and is time, resource and expertise heavy.

Digital twin for indoor disaster in smart city: A systematic review,Shaharuddin S.,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVI-4-W3-2021-315-2022,11,True,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,Bangi,Malaysia,"Technology has advanced and progressed tremendously, and the term city is being elevated to a new level where the smart city has been introduced globally. Recent developments in the concept of smart city have led to a renewed interest in Digital Twin. Using precise Building Information Modelling (BIM) consolidated with big data and sensors, several attempts have been made to establish digital twin smart cities. In recent years, several researchers have sought to determine the capability of smart city and digital twin for various taxonomies such as development and urban planning purposes, built environment, manufacturing, environmental, disaster management, and healthcare. Despite being beneficial in many disciplines, especially in manufacturing, built environment, and urban planning, these existing studies have shown a lack of aspect in terms of emergency or disaster-related as opposed to the elements mentioned above. This is because the researcher has not treated emergencies or disasters in much detail. Therefore, an extensive review on smart city, digital twin, BIM and disaster management and technology that revolves around these terms were summarised. In general, 39 articles from prominent multidisciplinary databases were retrieved over the last two decades based on the suggested PRISMA workflow. These final articles were analysed and categorised into four themes based on the research content, gist, and keywords. Based on the review of 39 articles related to smart city, digital twin and BIM, a workflow for the smart city digital twin and the conceptual framework for indoor disaster management was proposed accordingly. The establishment of smart city digital twins solely for an indoor emergency can be beneficial to urbanites, and it could provide numerous benefits for enhanced situation assessment, decision making, coordination, and resource allocation.","['management', 'new', 'several', 'existing', 'decades', 'sought', 'making', 'various', 'elevated', 'therefore', 'healthcare', 'indoor', 'globally', 'extensive', 'smart', 'cities', 'prominent', 'attempts', 'proposed', 'solely', 'categorised', 'recent', 'two', 'elements', 'themes', 'articles', 'opposed', 'shown', 'sensors', 'manufacturing', 'four', 'technology', 'tremendously', 'made', 'progressed', 'urbanites', 'provide', 'general', 'modelling', 'could', 'prisma', 'numerous', 'final', 'disasterrelated', 'bim', 'disciplines', 'gist', 'renewed', 'determine', 'led', 'terms', 'around', 'developments', 'benefits', 'detail', 'allocation', 'years', 'last', 'precise', 'disasters', 'analysed', 'emergency', 'digital', 'beneficial', 'disaster', 'related', 'studies', 'coordination', 'advanced', 'despite', 'multidisciplinary', 'built', 'enhanced', 'twin', 'workflow', 'introduced', 'establish', 'lack', 'researcher', 'city', 'capability', 'establishment', 'resource', 'revolves', 'treated', 'term', 'review', 'interest', 'purposes', 'situation', 'suggested', 'taxonomies', 'keywords', 'environmental', 'concept', 'building', 'conceptual', 'databases', 'consolidated', 'researchers', 'summarised', 'aspect', 'emergencies', 'much', 'twins', 'accordingly', 'environment', 'level', 'content', 'retrieved', 'especially', 'decision', 'many', 'mentioned']",2022,"[(3, 0.99846125)]"

While existing literature acknowledges the potential benefits of smart cities, such as the growth of the economy and improved city operations, their inclusivity has received little research. Without appropriate strategies and indicators that measure, and support inclusion, minorities and underrepresented populations may experience social and digital exclusion. Therefore, this paper aims to review and synthesize the research on inclusivity in smart cities. My research questions are: (1) why is it vital to measure the effectiveness of inclusivity in a smart city? and (2) how do we measure and ensure that cities are being built with inclusion in mind? The methodology is an investigation into the models, frameworks, and tools that are used by current scholars and practitioners.

"Evaluation of Smart Agitation Prediction and Management for Dementia Care and Novel Universal Village Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness and Sustainability",Zhang K.,"6th IEEE International Conference on Universal Village, UV 2022",10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185497,0,False,Universal Village Society,Cambridge,United States,"At present, the world is being faced with the challenge of an aging population, correlating to a growing number of seniors with dementia. With this uptick in persons with dementia (PWD), managing dementia-induced agitation, a behavior present in 90 precent of PWD characterized by physical aggression, verbal outburst, or other troubling behavior, is a pressing issue [1]. Caregiver burden associated with agitation is one of the leading causes a community-based PWD is institutionalized [2], so by supporting PWD-caregiver dyads, we improve individual quality of life and relieve stress placed on the global healthcare system. Use of AI technology, big data, and integrated networks of wearable and ambient sensors has enabled continuous monitoring of dementia care. However, most methods focus on data collection at the early stages of dementia. More research is needed on how novel technologies can empower PWD and their caregivers to take action to manage agitation and support them in the long term as symptoms progress. Moreover, current methods have not taken full advantage of the information obtained and do not provide personalized care. In this paper, we use the Universal Village (UV) perspective to evaluate the current status of smart technologies with the potential for use in preventing and mitigating agitation while providing support to the caregiver. We conduct evaluations based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that a robust PWD agitation management system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how managing agitation would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design. As such, the novel framework will improve PWD quality of life and reduce the care burden for formal and informal caregivers through continuous, unobtrusive monitoring, life-long agitation management throughout different stages of dementia, PWD-caregiver dyad-specific guidance, preventive healthcare, and timely treatment.","['community', 'management', 'number', 'symptoms', 'aggression', 'enabled', 'use', 'preventive', 'dementia', 'relationship', 'outburst', 'systematic', 'troubling', 'stages', 'making', 'preventing', 'improve', 'providing', 'associated', 'healthcare', 'global', 'continuous', 'would', 'reduce', 'complicated', 'caregiver', 'dyads', 'smart', 'cities', 'formal', 'present', 'needed', 'monitoring', 'burden', 'managing', 'aging', 'seven', 'faced', 'sustainable', 'population', 'sensors', 'manage', 'uvoriented', 'institutionalized', 'affected', 'leading', 'technology', 'four', 'dynamic', 'major', 'resilient', 'provide', 'challenge', 'dyadspecific', 'informal', 'guidance', 'characterized', 'full', 'caregivers', 'novel', 'crowd', 'placed', 'long', 'integrated', 'world', 'propose', 'collection', 'inclusive', 'take', 'multiple', 'lifelong', 'correlating', 'early', 'communitybased', 'interaction', 'personalized', 'perspective', 'precent', 'village', 'pwd', 'behavior', 'emergency', 'closed', 'impacting', 'one', 'obtained', 'timely', 'technologies', 'growing', 'stress', 'protection', 'empower', 'care', 'agitation', 'robust', 'evaluations', 'humanity', 'pressing', 'factors', 'ambient', 'transportation', 'us', 'feedback', 'uptick', 'persons', 'communication', 'cycle', 'supporting', 'conduct', 'advantage', 'relieve', 'subsystems', 'loop', 'energy', 'intelligent', 'control', 'status', 'infrastructure', 'individual', 'city', 'treatment', 'term', 'lifestyle', 'help', 'potential', 'universal', 'issue', 'networks', 'progress', 'flow', 'material', 'environmental', 'explore', 'physical', 'depth', 'home', 'uv', 'life', 'acquisition', 'focus', 'unobtrusive', 'quality', 'evaluate', 'dementiainduced', 'different', 'mitigating', 'throughout', 'support', 'current', 'wearable', 'consideration', 'system', 'verbal', 'causes', 'action', 'moreover', 'seniors', 'response', 'taken', 'pwdcaregiver', 'decision', 'ai']",2022,"[(2, 0.9988852)]"

The Rebranding of Newcastle as a Smart City. Cui Bono?,Avril E.,Angles,10.4000/angles.5798,0,True,Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris III,Paris,France,"The city of Newcastle, regional capital of North East England and home to “the UK’s smartest street” located a short distance from its brand new Helix district, is described as having successfully transitioned from a traditionally industrial city to a “smart” city, able to use digital tools to address issues such as congestion, pollution, waste reduction and parking, with the dual objective of “helping people to live better lives” and of making the city more attractive to businesses, investors, international students, and tourists. While ubiquitous in political and academic discourse, the idea of “smart city” is strikingly absent from general public discussion, with very low awareness among those whose lives are supposed to be most improved. Criticisms of smart cities tend to focus on the fact that the services associated with smart cities constitute a very lucrative market, on the lack of residents’ involvement in changes that will directly affect their everyday life, and on the potential for misuse of the data collected. Drawing primarily from a range of published material such as policy documents, newsletters, working papers, announcements, websites, and brochures produced by the key players of the smart city, as well as from conversations with ordinary residents, this article aims to contribute to the discussion on smart cities by confronting official discourses with “actually existing” practices, through the case of the mid-sized city of Newcastle. It explores the uses of smart city tools and discourse to rebrand the city of Newcastle and revitalise civic pride, setting the smart city promises against actual improvements to the lives of local residents as well as their perceptions of their city. The first section of the article sets out the elements of the smart city to show how the characteristics of the city of Newcastle made it an ideal terrain for experimentations; the second section analyses the deployment of the smart city agenda in the city, focusing on the discourses and perceptions of the range of players involved. The third and final section seeks to understand who is set to benefit the most from Newcastle’s transition to a “smart city”.

The changes in planning culture that have taken place in the last decades—especially the so‐called communicative turn in planning in the 1990s—have brought about an increased attention to a growing range of stakeholders of urban development, their interests, logics, and participation in planning as well as the negotiation processes between these stakeholders. However, while this has also been researched in breadth and depth, only scant attention has been paid to the knowledge (claims) of these stakeholders. In planning practice, knowledge, implicit and explicit, has been a highly relevant topic for quite some time: It is discussed how local knowledge can inform urban planning, how experimental knowledge on urban development can be generated in living labs, and what infrastructures can process “big data” and make it usable for planning, to name a few examples.

Neighborhood sustainability assessment tools: Research trends and forecast for the built environment,Dawodu A.,Sustainable Futures,10.1016/j.sftr.2022.100064,16,True,University of Nottingham Ningbo China,Ningbo,China,"Rapid urbanization, environmental concerns and demand for sustainable cities contributed to the development of Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment Tools (NSATs) such as LEED-ND and BREEAM-Communities. Whilst their success in increasing sustainability outcomes within the built environment is evident, there are unnoticed gaps in NSAT frameworks that might hinder their future suitability for sustainable urban planning and design. Therefore, to remain pertinent, NSATs must address the constantly evolving sustainability issues. To determine the gaps in NSATs frameworks and identify trends in sustainable communities, this study utilised a bibliometric exploration of NSAT-related publications. A total of 117 research articles over the last decade were reviewed to inform and provide insights on the research and development needs as well as areas of enhancing NSATs efficacy. The results revealed that research methods used to evaluate NSATs in journal articles are predominantly qualitative. This significantly limits the precision of research outcomes and highlights the need to increase quantitative (experiential and experimental) performance-based investigations which provide context and practically relevant outcomes. Furthermore, an upsurge in research themes related to big data and climate change, focused on smartness and resilience, was revealed.

Evaluation of Community Livability Using Gridded Basic Urban Geographical Data—A Case Study of Wuhan,Luo Q.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi11010038,10,True,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"The evaluation of community livability quantifies the demands of human settlement at the micro scale, supporting urban governance decision-making at the macro scale. Big data generated by the urban management of government agencies can provide an accurate, real-time, and rich data set for livability evaluation. However, these data are intertwined by overlapping geographical management boundaries of different government agencies. It causes the difficulty of data integration and utilization when evaluating community livability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a scheme of partitioning basic geographical space into grids by optimally integrating various geographical management boundaries relevant to enterprise-level big data. Furthermore, the system of indexes on community livability is created, and the evaluation model of community livability is constructed. TakingWuhan as an example, the effectiveness of the model is verified. After the evaluation, the experimental results show that the livability evaluation with reference to our basic geographic grids can effectively make use of governmental big data to spatially identify the multidimensional characteristics of a community, including management, environment, facility services, safety, and health.

This paper’s contribution is twofold. We first introduce co-design as a method for developing a planning support tool such as RAISE and present findings from a series of co-design workshops that informed its development. Findings included the need for further transparency of the land valuation process and recommendation of a community feature that explains valuation outcomes to landowners. The resulting insights from the co-design process led to a series of emerging questions that the design of this type of planning support system raises: (a) the collaboration with local government partners and the need for what Huybrechts calls “institutioning;” (b) some of the ethical implications of use, and (c) the impact of moving from conventional to AI/machine learning-assisted modeling. We discuss these questions as part of our second contribution.

Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) help to position cycling as a daily transportation option and have been widely established in many countries. Previous studies have investigated the association between urban environmental factors and BSSs’ demand to promote the broader use of BSSs and determine whether demand is affected by various factors. However, research on the effects of the urban environment on BSS demand according to the trip purpose (e.g., commuting and leisure) is rare due to the difficulty in understanding users’ trip purposes. In this regard, recent advancements in big data technologies make massive BSSs trip data available to the public, which is useful for in-depth analyzing BSS travel patterns and inferring the trip purposes. This study thus analyzes to what extent demand is affected by urban environmental factors for different trip purposes, focusing on Seoul Bike, through the integration of clustering users’ travel patterns and analyzing geospatial data affecting demand. By observing trip data, BSS trips were clustered into short-distance travel for utilitarian purposes and longer-distance roaming for recreational purposes. The utilitarian trips were more affected by the large floating population and high land-use mix, and they were more concentrated during the rush hours in the crowded areas, while the leisure trips were more concentrated in secluded residential areas and were close to the waterfront. This study can contribute to establishing plans to increase the demand for and optimize the operation of BSSs.","['patterns', 'systems', 'large', 'use', 'high', 'integration', 'users', 'various', 'hours', 'reduce', 'investigated', 'bikesharing', 'form', 'society', 'contribute', 'mix', 'clustering', 'eg', 'recent', 'seoul', 'secluded', 'sustainable', 'geospatial', 'cycling', 'population', 'demand', 'bike', 'waterfront', 'affected', 'whether', 'advancements', 'due', 'individuals', 'broader', 'usage', 'affecting', 'concentrated', 'areas', 'determine', 'residential', 'operation', 'option', 'trips', 'crowded', 'previous', 'public', 'commuting', 'technologies', 'studies', 'widely', 'leisure', 'factors', 'clustered', 'inferring', 'transportation', 'extent', 'car', 'available', 'association', 'benefit', 'rare', 'increase', 'established', 'useful', 'travel', 'shortdistance', 'plans', 'difficulty', 'establishing', 'according', 'rush', 'bsss', 'focusing', 'close', 'effects', 'daily', 'purpose', 'countries', 'bss', 'utilitarian', 'indepth', 'help', 'purposes', 'observing', 'environmental', 'longerdistance', 'massive', 'optimize', 'trip', 'analyzing', 'different', 'landuse', 'thus', 'analyzes', 'make', 'environment', 'recreational', 'regard', 'roaming', 'position', 'promote', 'many', 'floating']",2022,"[(0, 0.09170462), (1, 0.6556024), (2, 0.25217092)]"

There is a strong consistency between the population distribution center and the level of urban development. The urban human migration network is centered on provincial capitals or municipalities at the regional scale, showing a prominent ""center-periphery"" structure. COVID-19 dispersed the forces of human migration in time and changed the direction of human migration in space. But it did not change the pattern of national migration. The most critical factors influencing mass migration are income levels and traditional culture. This study reveals the impacts of major public health emergencies on conventional migration patterns and provides a scientific theoretical reference for COVID-19 prevention and control.","['capitals', 'patterns', 'decreased', 'social', 'influencing', 'analyze', 'human', 'structure', 'theoretical', 'conventional', 'time', 'prevention', 'line', 'scale', 'sparse', 'measures', 'cities', 'prominent', 'traditional', 'holidays', 'presents', 'provincial', 'levels', 'population', 'beijing', 'dispersed', 'diamond', 'affected', 'major', 'scientific', 'west', 'found', 'determinants', 'network', 'mass', 'reference', 'space', 'pandemic', 'provides', 'strong', 'chinese', 'weekends', 'combat', 'perspective', 'chinas', 'strict', 'public', 'chengdu', 'reveals', 'national', 'prior', 'compared', 'culture', 'factors', 'dense', 'center', 'municipalities', 'health', 'intensity', 'east', 'lockdowns', 'initiated', 'overall', 'consistency', 'showing', 'impacted', 'outbreak', 'control', 'direction', 'distribution', 'centered', 'hu', 'income', 'severely', 'impacts', 'centerperiphery', 'connect', 'critical', 'pattern', 'bounded', 'identify', 'guangzhou', 'emergencies', 'period', 'shanghai', 'change', 'changed', 'level', 'forces', 'migration', 'regional', 'nodes']",2021,"[(0, 0.44368166), (1, 0.55520535)]"
Population Spatial Distribution Based on Luojia 1–01 Nighttime Light Image: A Case Study of Beijing,Sun L.,Chinese Geographical Science,10.1007/s11769-021-1240-6,10,True,Beijing Forestry University,Beijing,China,"With the continuous development of urbanization in China, the country’s growing population brings great challenges to urban development. By mastering the refined population spatial distribution in administrative units, the quantity and agglomeration of population distribution can be estimated and visualized. It will provide a basis for a more rational urban planning. This paper takes Beijing as the research area and uses a new Luojia1–01 nighttime light image with high resolution, land use type data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and other data to construct the population spatial index system, establishing the index weight based on the principal component analysis. The comprehensive weight value of population distribution in the study area was then used to calculate the street population distribution of Beijing in 2018. Then the population spatial distribution was visualize using GIS technology. After accuracy assessments by comparing the result with the WorldPop data, the accuracy has reached 0.74. The proposed method was validated as a qualified method to generate population spatial maps. By contrast of local areas, Luojia 1–01 data is more suitable for population distribution estimation than the NPP/VIIRS (Net Primary Productivity/Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer) nighttime light data.

The underlying components of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: a case study approach to an applied theoretical framework,Bibri S.E.,European Journal of Futures Research,10.1186/s40309-021-00182-3,14,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"The increased pressure on cities has led to a stronger need to build sustainable cities that can last. Planning sustainable cities of the future, educated by the lessons of the past and anticipating the challenges of the future, entails articulating a multi-scalar vision that, by further interplaying with major societal trends and paradigm shifts in science and technology, produce new opportunities towards reaching the goals of sustainability. Enabled by big data science and analytics, the ongoing transformative processes within sustainable cities are motivated by the need to address and overcome the challenges hampering progress towards sustainability. This means that sustainable cities should be understood, analyzed, planned, designed, and managed in new and innovative ways in order to improve and advance their contribution to sustainability. Therefore, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of data-driven technologies and applied solutions so as to optimize, enhance, and maintain their performance and thus achieve the desired outcomes of sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” Based on a case study analysis, this paper develops an applied theoretical framework for strategic sustainable urban development planning. This entails identifying and integrating the underlying components of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future in terms of the dimensions, strategies, and solutions of the leading global paradigms of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in combining compact urban design strategies, eco-city design strategies and technology solutions; data-driven smart city technologies, competences, and solutions for sustainability; and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable city solutions and strategies. These combined have great potential to improve and advance the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability through harnessing its synergistic effects and balancing the integration of its dimensions. The main contribution of this work lies in providing new insights into guiding the development of various types of strategic planning processes of transformative change towards sustainability, as well as to stimulate and inspire future research endeavors in this direction.

This study proposes a road network reconfiguration (RnR) framework for disaster evacuation planning. The proposed model proposes a method to reconfigure a road network that can consider various factors based on open-source geographical information systems data. The proposed model first presents a big data processing method for generating an evacuation plan from actual large-scale road network data. This method is adopted for effective routes for large objects. Second, the proposed framework derives routes by disaster risk and is not limited to the minimum route cost, ensuring an optimal safe route according to the degree of risk. As a result, the proposed RnR framework contributes to the resilience of cities by enabling decision-makers and executives in disaster management to design action plans to avoid city risks and conserve human resources.","['avoid', 'become', 'prioritizing', 'adopted', 'executives', 'management', 'largescale', 'disasters', 'decisions', 'resilience', 'systems', 'reconfigure', 'frequency', 'large', 'consider', 'route', 'evacuation', 'increases', 'method', 'effective', 'optimal', 'disaster', 'result', 'must', 'human', 'cost', 'generating', 'plan', 'various', 'geographical', 'factors', 'limited', 'critical', 'first', 'difficult', 'reconfiguration', 'road', 'network', 'actual', 'ensuring', 'routes', 'risks', 'conserve', 'proposes', 'cities', 'contributes', 'plans', 'opensource', 'proposed', 'degree', 'safe', 'processing', 'action', 'minimum', 'make', 'according', 'worldwide', 'rnr', 'resources', 'managers', 'second', 'derives', 'risk', 'decisionmakers', 'enabling', 'objects', 'presents', 'city']",2021,"[(0, 0.7211445), (2, 0.27654505)]"
Quantifying physical and psychological perceptions of urban scenes using deep learning,Zhang Y.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105762,28,False,Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"The complicated relationship between urban scenes and public perceptions has long been a concern in many disciplines. Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents’ perspectives.

Data-driven smart eco-cities and sustainable integrated districts: A best-evidence synthesis approach to an extensive literature review,Bibri S.E.,European Journal of Futures Research,10.1186/s40309-021-00181-4,36,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"As materializations of trends toward developing and implementing urban socio-technical and enviro-economic experiments for transition, eco-cities have recently received strong government and institutional support in many countries around the world due to their ability to function as an innovative strategic niche where to test and introduce various reforms. There are many models of the eco-city based mainly on either following the principles of urban ecology or combining the strategies of sustainable cities and the solutions of smart cities. The most prominent among these models are sustainable integrated districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. The latter model represents the unprecedented transformative changes the eco-city is currently undergoing in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. This is motivated by the growing need to tackle the problematicity surrounding eco-cities in terms of their planning, development, and governance approaches and practices. Employing a combination of both best-evidence synthesis and narrative approaches, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art and thematic literature review on sustainable integrated districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. The latter new area is a significant gap in and of itself that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of eco-urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed in the era of big data, what driving factors are behind it, and what forms and directions it takes. This study reveals that eco-city district developments are increasingly embracing compact city strategies and becoming a common expansion route for growing cities to achieve urban ecology or urban sustainability. It also shows that the new eco-city projects are increasingly capitalizing on data-driven smart technologies to implement environmental, economic, and social reforms. This is being accomplished by combining the strengths of eco-cities and smart cities and harnessing the synergies of their strategies and solutions in ways that enable eco-cities to improve their performance with respect to sustainability as to its tripartite composition. This in turn means that big data technologies will change eco-urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways in terms of how eco-cities will be monitored, understood, analyzed, planned, designed, and governed. However, smart urbanism poses significant risks and drawbacks that need to be addressed and overcome in order to achieve the desired outcomes of ecological sustainability in its broader sense. One of the key critical questions raised in this regard pertains to the very potentiality of the technocratic governance of data-driven smart eco-cities and the associated negative implications and hidden pitfalls. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in eco-urbanism, this study seeks to assist policymakers and planners in assessing the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating ecologically sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on this topic.","['models', 'pitfalls', 'technocratic', 'tripartite', 'recently', 'new', 'social', 'uptake', 'common', 'route', 'district', 'integration', 'questions', 'potentiality', 'well', 'improve', 'various', 'transition', 'associated', 'enviroeconomic', 'literature', 'implications', 'policymakers', 'reforms', 'hidden', 'monitored', 'datadriven', 'together', 'problematicity', 'shedding', 'seeks', 'smart', 'prospective', 'cities', 'strategic', 'niche', 'prominent', 'forms', 'sociotechnical', 'received', 'institutional', 'currently', 'employing', 'following', 'recent', 'outcomes', 'compact', 'undergoing', 'takes', 'urbanism', 'ecourbanism', 'adoption', 'innovative', 'combining', 'assessing', 'driving', 'sustainable', 'ecologically', 'drawbacks', 'significant', 'sustainability', 'increasingly', 'implement', 'motivated', 'technology', 'irreversible', 'fundamental', 'shift', 'need', 'ecocities', 'narrative', 'harnessing', 'understood', 'due', 'ecological', 'ability', 'tackle', 'combination', 'becoming', 'addressed', 'either', 'economic', 'strengths', 'embracing', 'broader', 'toward', 'directions', 'addition', 'shows', 'synergies', 'integrated', 'world', 'around', 'terms', 'provides', 'ecology', 'developments', 'stateoftheart', 'strong', 'enable', 'stimulate', 'developing', 'means', 'thematic', 'test', 'expansion', 'analytics', 'desired', 'surrounding', 'approaches', 'negative', 'debates', 'ways', 'solutions', 'analyzed', 'one', 'mainly', 'technologies', 'reveals', 'principles', 'growing', 'order', 'strategies', 'factors', 'pertains', 'gap', 'extent', 'key', 'introduce', 'planners', 'function', 'represents', 'paradigm', 'light', 'era', 'achieve', 'overcome', 'effectuating', 'capitalizing', 'assist', 'experiments', 'science', 'increasing', 'transformative', 'practices', 'designed', 'turn', 'changes', 'respect', 'government', 'planned', 'city', 'ecocity', 'governance', 'countries', 'comprehensive', 'transformations', 'accomplished', 'review', 'area', 'behind', 'pros', 'environmental', 'critical', 'implementing', 'bestevidence', 'projects', 'risks', 'sense', 'support', 'synthesis', 'materializations', 'cons', 'change', 'latter', 'districts', 'composition', 'among', 'governed', 'topic', 'fill', 'raised', 'trends', 'poses', 'regard', 'brought', 'many', 'unprecedented']",2021,"[(3, 0.9990664)]"
What makes a city ‘smart’ in the Anthropocene? A critical review of smart cities under climate change,Obringer R.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103278,45,True,National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC),College Park,United States,"In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review.

We detail the data and spatial system, showing how we extend the model to visualise spatial interactions as vector fields and accessibility indicators. We briefly demonstrate the implementation of the model and outline how we can generate the impact of changes in employment and changes in travel costs that enable transport modes to compete for travellers.

Travel mode recognition of urban residents using mobile phone data and MapAPI,Peng Z.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/2399808320983001,11,True,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"Obtaining the time and space features of the travel of urban residents can facilitate urban traffic optimization and urban planning. As traditional methods often have limited sample coverage and lack timeliness, the application of big data such as mobile phone data in urban studies makes it possible to rapidly acquire the features of residents’ travel. However, few studies have attempted to use them to recognize the travel modes of residents. Based on mobile phone call detail records and the Web MapAPI, the present study proposes a method to recognize the travel mode of urban residents. The main processes include: (a) using DBSCAN clustering to analyze each user’s important location points and identify their main travel trajectories; (b) using an online map API to analyze user’s means of travel; (c) comparing the two to recognize the travel mode of residents. Applying this method in a GIS platform can further help obtain the traffic flow of various means, such as walking, driving, and public transit, on different roads during peak hours on weekdays. Results are cross-checked with other data sources and are proven effective. Besides recognizing travel modes of residents, the proposed method can also be applied for studies such as travel costs, housing–job balance, and road traffic pressure. The study acquires about 6 million residents’ travel modes, working place and residence information, and analyzes the means of travel and traffic flow in the commuting of 3 million residents using the proposed method. The findings not only provide new ideas for the collection and application of urban traffic information, but also provide data support for urban planning and traffic management.","['mapapi', 'management', 'points', 'new', 'walking', 'web', 'use', 'applied', 'method', 'analyze', 'proven', 'recognizing', 'million', 'users', 'time', 'various', 'map', 'hours', 'makes', 'limited', 'traffic', 'recognize', 'dbscan', 'proposed', 'trajectories', 'present', 'traditional', 'pressure', 'clustering', 'mode', 'weekdays', 'housingjob', 'two', 'peak', 'location', 'driving', 'effective', 'acquire', 'timeliness', 'provide', 'processes', 'ideas', 'call', 'road', 'rapidly', 'space', 'include', 'collection', 'means', 'acquires', 'c', 'detail', 'comparing', 'public', 'records', 'important', 'commuting', 'studies', 'b', 'coverage', 'besides', 'residence', 'costs', 'balance', 'attempted', 'optimization', 'main', 'api', 'obtain', 'online', 'proposes', 'travel', 'applying', 'crosschecked', 'lack', 'sample', 'platform', 'mobile', 'phone', 'help', 'obtaining', 'flow', 'facilitate', 'roads', 'modes', 'features', 'gis', 'residents', 'identify', 'different', 'possible', 'support', 'sources', 'analyzes', 'working', 'place', 'often', 'transit']",2021,"[(1, 0.99858767)]"
Modeling urban residential land price distribution using multi-source data and ensemble learning: A case of Wuhan City,Zhang P.,Progress in Geography,10.18306/dlkxjz.2021.10.005,3,False,Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,Beijing,China,"Characterizing the spatial distribution of urban residential land prices (RLPs) is essential for timely improving urban planning and management, as well as for effectively realizing urban smart growth. However, mapping urban RLPs at a fine scale remains challenging, due to the complex nonlinear relationship between RLPs and their potential determinants. This study developed a grid-level urban RLP mapping method based on big geo-data and ensemble learning technology to meet the needs of rapid and accurate monitoring of urban RLP dynamics. Using ensemble learning technology, combined with predictor variables extracted from points of interest (POIs) and NPP-VIIRS nighttime light images, the fine-scale RLPs in Wuhan City in 2018 were mapped through the following steps. First, the kernel density of POIs and the intensity of nighttime lights were extracted and aggregated at the 500 m × 500 m grid level as the predictor variables of RLPs. Second, several RLP prediction models were established using four individual machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and bagging and stacking ensemble methods. Finally, the prediction accuracy or errors of different models were evaluated and compared, and the best performing model was selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids with no observations in Wuhan City. The results show that: 1) Among all the individual MLAs, the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm has the best prediction performance, followed by the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and back propagation neural network (BP-NN) algorithms. 2) In terms of improving the prediction accuracy of individual MLAs, the performance of the stacking method is better than that of the bagging method. The stacking #1 model that integrates the SVR and k-NN algorithms has the smallest prediction error, with % MAE of 8.29%, and R2 of 0.814. 3) The RLP map generated by the proposed methodological framework can effectively reveal the circular characteristics and local singularity of the RLP distribution.

Classification of shrinking cities in China using Baidu big data,Meng X.,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,10.11821/dlxb202110010,24,False,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"In the context of rapid urbanization, shrinking cities cannot be ignored. The classification of shrinking cities according to the patterns of urban population changes is the key to reveal the ""hollow"" and changing characteristics of the population. Researchers classified the shrinking cities in Western developed countries as ""perforated"", ""doughnut"" and ""peripheral"" types. However, there is a lack of evidence showing the types of shrinking cities in China. This paper takes the redefined physical cities in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) as the study area, and employs Baidu Huiyan's 200 m × 200 m grid cell permanent population data from November 2016 to November 2018 to identify different types of shrinking cities in the country. Our results show that 1506 physical cities have experienced a population reduction between 2016 and 2018, accounting for 49.8% of the total number of physical cities (3022). Furthermore, in order to accurately identify the types of shrinking cities, 126 densely populated and severely shrinking cities during the study period were selected as the research samples, mainly located to north of the Qinling Mountains and Huaihe River of China. Our analysis shows that the shrinking types of the sample cities can be classified into five categories: ""perforated"", ""complete"", ""local"", ""doughnut"", and ""peripheral"". The number of cities with perforated shrinkage is the largest, which numbered 47 (37.3% of the sample cities), most of which are found in Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Gansu Province. Complete shrinkage ranks the second, including 33 cities, which accounts for 26.2% of the samples, and mainly distributed in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The numbers of shrinking cities with local, doughnut and peripheral types are 25, 18 and 3, respectively. These cities are mainly distributed in Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia. This is because the governments paid more attention to the development speed over quality during the first half of China's urbanization process, and adopted a growth-oriented urban planning strategy. Traditional industries declined due to resource depletion or economic transformation, and the transfer of industries under active government adjustment, all of which contribute to the emergence of perforated shrinkage.

Three components (city plans, the patterns of building forms, and urban land use) are included in the framework of the urban landscape. A three-level evaluation model based on t-tests is developed to determine the effectiveness of historic preservation zoning. The results of a case study of 12 Chinese cities show that, first, not all urban landscape indicators are appropriate for preservation zoning evaluation and, secondly, preservation zones have been designated both larger and smaller than is necessary, which may be explained by discontinuities in some protection policies.

Literature review of foreign research on commercial gentrification and the enlightenment for Chinese studies,Sun J.,World Regional Studies,10.3969/j.issn.1004-9479.2021.05.2019592,2,False,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"Commerce is the most active and one of the most important functions of a city, which significantly influences the urban development and urban restructuring process. Though gentrification has becoming a hot topic of urban studies since 1960s, much less attention has been focused on the commercial changes compared with the residential counterpart. Commercial gentrification is the phenomenon of class displacement caused by retail up-gradation, which has become a generalized transformation of commercially utilizing urban space that mostly catering to middle and up-class consumers. In recent two decades, increasingly evident commercial gentrification phenomenon emerges with the rising of cultural and creative industry, as well as retail-oriented revitalization practices in many countries. So, it attracts worldwide academic attention, and specific studies on commercial gentrification becomes more than before, which also due to multiple sources of big data and new quantitative analysis. Although several Chinese geography researchers have already made academic reviews on gentrification studies, there is nothing on commercial gentrification specially still now.

Secondly, it summarizes the contents of these papers, according to the background of neighborhoods commercial changes, the characteristics, the promoters and mechanism of commercial upgradation, as well as the social effects in displacement and segregation. It argues that the concept of commercial gentrification coined by Zukin should be expanded, and majority studies are restricted to a narrow explanation of empirical researches, which to some extent due to the limiting of available data and wide-used methods in a long time. Thirdly, it puts forward some gaps of commercial gentrification studies based on the trend and characteristics of urban revitalization and consumption transformation in current China, which will contributes to the understanding of the complexity of gentrification geography.

Principal results include: (1) on average, each Tucson resident paid 2.02 visits to parks in 2019; (2) for each 100-m2 park area, river/linear parks and other types of parks can attract 9.8 and 2.6 visits, respectively, on an annual basis; (3) smaller parks are popular during the weekdays, whereas larger parks attract more visits over the weekends; and (4) park perimeter is another critical design variable in addition to park size in explaining park visits.

Therefore, the major goals of this research are to: 1) review the literature on the influence of ICTs on urban areas; 2) analyse the research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cities; and 3) analyse new policies and resolutions on urban and city planning.","['intelligence', 'become', 'adopted', 'green', 'developed', 'new', 'structure', 'reconsideration', 'movement', 'therefore', 'tackling', 'global', 'literature', 'goals', 'algorithms', 'cities', 'policies', 'recent', 'representing', 'accelerated', 'artificial', 'population', 'flexibility', 'rethinking', 'sustainability', 'cent', 'technology', 'per', 'major', 'due', 'provide', 'processes', 'policymaking', 'worlds', 'central', 'onethird', 'allowing', 'conversion', 'areas', 'world', 'pandemic', 'thanks', 'around', 'challenges', 'better', 'developing', 'years', 'computing', 'enhancing', 'resilience', 'great', 'public', 'digital', 'icts', 'ways', 'lived', 'solutions', 'technologies', 'metropolises', 'order', 'key', 'typology', 'function', 'quantum', 'existence', 'people', 'spaces', 'according', 'resolutions', 'abandoned', 'fifteenminute', 'influence', 'employment', 'city', 'demonstrated', 'countries', 'review', 'mobility', 'equivalent', 'ict', 'functions', 'approximately', 'environments', 'innovation', 'investment', 'efficient', 'analyse', 'services', 'communications', 'unhabitat', 'ai']",2021,"[(3, 0.9980735)]"
"A mechanistic data-driven approach to synthesize human mobility considering the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions together",Cornacchia G.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi10090599,5,True,Università di Pisa,Pisa,Italy,"Modelling human mobility is crucial in several areas, from urban planning to epidemic modelling, traffic forecasting, and what-if analysis. Existing generative models focus mainly on reproducing the spatial and temporal dimensions of human mobility, while the social aspect, though it influences human movements significantly, is often neglected. Those models that capture some social perspectives of human mobility utilize trivial and unrealistic spatial and temporal mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the Spatial, Temporal and Social Exploration and Preferential Return model (STS-EPR), which embeds mechanisms to capture the spatial, temporal, and social aspects together. We compare the trajectories produced by STS-EPR with respect to real-world trajectories and synthetic trajectories generated by two state-of-the-art generative models on a set of standard mobility measures. Our experiments conducted on an open dataset show that STS-EPR, overall, outperforms existing spatial-temporal or social models demonstrating the importance of modelling adequately the sociality to capture precisely all the other dimensions of human mobility. We further investigate the impact of the tile shape of the spatial tessellation on the performance of our model.

Measuring urban regional similarity through mobility signatures,McKenzie G.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101684,18,False,Université McGill,Montreal,Canada,"The task of identifying similar regions within and between cities is an important aspect of urban data science as well as applied domains such as real estate, tourism, and urban planning. Regional similarity is typically assessed through comparing socio-demographic variables, resource availability, or urban infrastructure. An essential dimension, often overlooked for this task, is the spatiotemporal mobility patterns of people within a city. In this work we present a novel approach to identifying regional similarity based on human mobility as proxied through micromobility trips. We use a dataset consisting of e-scooter trip origins and destinations for two major European cities that differ in population size and urban structure. Three dimensions of these data are used in modeling the spatial and temporal variability in movement between regions in cities, allowing us to compare regions through a mobility lens. The result is a parameterized similarity model and interactive web platform for comparing regions across different urban environments. The application of this model suggests that human mobility patterns are a quantifiable, unique, and appropriate characteristic through which to measure urban similarity.","['patterns', 'sociodemographic', 'web', 'use', 'applied', 'result', 'human', 'structure', 'well', 'movement', 'essential', 'dimensions', 'lens', 'compare', 'suggests', 'cities', 'characteristic', 'present', 'destinations', 'similar', 'similarity', 'estate', 'two', 'temporal', 'identifying', 'across', 'regions', 'modeling', 'population', 'three', 'parameterized', 'dataset', 'major', 'overlooked', 'interactive', 'typically', 'origins', 'variables', 'allowing', 'measure', 'novel', 'availability', 'task', 'variability', 'differ', 'trips', 'proxied', 'comparing', 'important', 'micromobility', 'us', 'assessed', 'within', 'people', 'dimension', 'science', 'quantifiable', 'unique', 'infrastructure', 'work', 'city', 'platform', 'resource', 'escooter', 'tourism', 'mobility', 'size', 'domains', 'environments', 'trip', 'appropriate', 'real', 'spatiotemporal', 'different', 'aspect', 'consisting', 'regional', 'often', 'european']",2021,"[(1, 0.6810034), (2, 0.317861)]"
Detecting the true urban polycentric pattern of Chinese cities in morphological dimensions: A multiscale analysis based on geospatial big data,Lv Y.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103298,37,False,Shandong Jianzhu University,Jinan,China,"With current decentralization trends and polycentric planning efforts, the urban spatial structures of Chinese cities have been changing tremendously.

The natural cities were delineated by points of interest (POIs), and road networks constituted street blocks. Based on check-in data and new spatial units, centers within both metropolitan areas and central cities were identified and examined. We discovered that all Chinese cities have at least one natural city in their metropolitan areas because of rapid urban sprawl. Although a monocentric structure is still the most common urban spatial structure, 110 Chinese cities displayed different degrees of polycentricity at the metropolitan level. Many natural cities beyond central cities contribute to polycentric development at the metropolitan level. Central cities have maintained their original vitality and importance, most Chinese cities have dispersed urban structures in central cities, and 45 central cities are polycentric. The spatial structures in metropolitan areas are more polycentric than those in central cities.

Study on Building a Smart Sustainable City Assessment Framework Using Big Data and Analytic Network Process,Wey W.M.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000704,8,False,National Taipei University,Taipei,Taiwan,"This study identifies indicators of urban sustainability and smart cities and then integrates them into a unified concept. Its aim is to reduce the gap in the literature between sustainable cities and smart cities with respect to urban development guidelines. Moreover, development directions for smart, sustainable, and inclusive urban environmental planning and design strategies are evaluated. To achieve these goals, a static evaluation system was developed and big data technique was used to construct a dynamic model. This model identifies factors that affect sustainable and smart cities and simulates changes in urban built environments under dynamic conditions, such as changes in regional development policies or space structures. Our proposed model is applied to examine the effects of both economic development and environmental issues on urban built environments. Moreover, changes in urban land intensification use mean that this model can be used to identify a set of management strategies that can meet planning targets and yield a sustainable urban built environment.

Causes of Spatial Patterns of Livability in Chinese Cities: MGWRL Analysis Based on Didi's Big Data,Hao J.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000711,6,False,University of Jinan,Jinan,China,"Continuous expansion results in urban problems such as congestion, pollution, and crime that seriously threaten the sustainable development of Chinese cities. How to promote the development of efficient and livable cities in China is of great significance in easing the pressure of urban development and promoting healthy urban development. Based on Didi's ""urban development index,""this study explores the spatial distribution and spatial driving factors of urban livability in China through Theil index decomposition, standard deviation ellipse analysis, global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and multiscale geographically weighted regression with lagged dependent variables (MGWRL) model analysis. The results reveal the following three points. First, China's urban livability presents a spatial pattern of ""east-west-middle""decreasing, with large spatial distribution differences and significant spatial dependence. Second, the effects of urban livability influencing factors have spatial scale differences. The impact of global variables such as human capital, fixed assets investment, medical level, and greening degree on urban livability is consistent at the global level. Local variables such as finance, urbanization, advanced industrial structure, and foreign trade only have consistent impacts on urban livability in local regions, and the scope of these regions varies with different variables. Third, it is further found that the effects of some local variables on urban livability have spatial heterogeneity. The effects of finance on urban livability shows a decreasing trend from east to west and from north to south in space; the effects of advanced industrial structure on urban livability are spatially characterized by outward radiation attenuation along the Yellow River and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; only less than one-third of the local regression coefficients of variables such as spatial lag, urbanization, and foreign trade passed the significance test. Relevant government departments should pay full attention to the spatial pattern and spatial dependence of urban livability in China, and make overall planning and improvement strategies; attention should be paid to the spatial scale difference and the spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors in policy formulation, and the differentiated development policy of livable cities should be put forward according to local conditions.","['yellow', 'mgwrl', 'points', 'large', 'lag', 'influencing', 'human', 'structure', 'theil', 'promoting', 'continuous', 'global', 'river', 'scale', 'passed', 'relevant', 'conditions', 'forward', 'cities', 'pressure', 'following', 'congestion', 'assets', 'spatially', 'second', 'south', 'presents', 'regions', 'driving', 'sustainable', 'trend', 'three', 'problems', 'decomposition', 'dependent', 'significant', 'pay', 'west', 'found', 'trade', 'less', 'middle', 'healthy', 'radiation', 'variables', 'characterized', 'full', 'onethird', 'shows', 'decreasing', 'space', 'degree', 'put', 'foreign', 'capital', 'ellipse', 'heterogeneity', 'index', 'chinese', 'test', 'expansion', 'along', 'autocorrelation', 'chinas', 'scope', 'great', 'didis', 'greening', 'fixed', 'livable', 'regression', 'deviation', 'geographically', 'livability', 'improvement', 'yangtze', 'easing', 'eastwestmiddledecreasing', 'strategies', 'factors', 'local', 'advanced', 'urbanization', 'east', 'crime', 'third', 'finance', 'weighted', 'overall', 'reaches', 'according', 'formulation', 'seriously', 'effects', 'lagged', 'government', 'distribution', 'policy', 'standard', 'explores', 'attention', 'difference', 'threaten', 'impacts', 'dependence', 'industrial', 'varies', 'departments', 'consistent', 'first', 'pattern', 'investment', 'coefficients', 'attenuation', 'different', 'efficient', 'pollution', 'significance', 'indexthis', 'differentiated', 'multiscale', 'make', 'paid', 'reveal', 'differences', 'level', 'medical', 'promote', 'north', 'outward']",2021,"[(1, 0.99893445)]"

Big data-driven pedestrian analytics: Unsupervised clustering and relational query based on tencent street view photographs,Xue F.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi10080561,14,True,The University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"Recent technological advancements in geomatics and mobile sensing have led to various urban big data, such as Tencent street view (TSV) photographs; yet, the urban objects in the big dataset have hitherto been inadequately exploited. This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines.","['models', 'walking', 'geomatics', 'technological', 'aims', 'generalizable', 'natural', 'view', 'various', 'enrich', 'tsv', 'uncountable', 'sky', 'traffic', 'pedestrians', 'smart', 'deep', 'hong', 'roadcrossing', 'carrying', 'clustering', 'eg', 'exploited', 'recent', 'two', 'estate', 'including', 'kong', 'language', 'hitherto', 'backpack', 'meaningful', 'conservation', 'dataset', 'advancements', 'street', 'inadequately', 'pet', 'extracting', 'pedestrian', 'adopts', 'showed', 'presented', 'geography', 'vectors', 'disciplines', 'photographic', 'propose', 'pixels', 'led', 'lights', 'enable', 'detected', 'successfully', 'sensing', 'analytics', 'surrounding', 'animals', 'cars', 'eyelevel', 'tencent', 'clustered', 'transportation', 'unstructured', 'countable', 'clauses', 'vegetation', 'semantically', 'path', 'indexed', 'third', 'activities', 'guardrail', 'objects', 'city', 'groups', 'island', 'named', 'mobile', 'behind', 'semantic', 'extracted', 'computational', 'trucks', 'features', 'yet', 'photographs', 'first', 'relations', 'pretrained', 'real', 'instances', 'transductively', 'paved', 'processing', 'usually', 'vucca', 'stand', 'queries']",2021,"[(3, 0.9982279)]"

"Toward the development of a vibrant, super-aged society: The future of medicine and society in Japan",Iijima K.,Geriatrics and Gerontology International,10.1111/ggi.14201,41,False,The University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"Background: As Japan's population continues to age, it is estimated that the number of people aged ≥75 years will exceed 20 million by 2025. Furthermore, over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it is important to address “frailty,” a condition in which people become more vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society. Current situation and problems: Disparity between healthy life expectancy and average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a paradigm shift from “cure-seeking medical care” to “cure- and support-seeking medical care.” Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are low in Japanese people aged ≥75 years; particularly in people aged ≥80 years, low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication of effects and the presence of drugs that “require particularly careful administration,” it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age. Contents of the proposal: In this report, we have put together a vision for the future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional organizations. The paradigm shift from “cure-seeking medical care” to “cure- and support-seeking medical care” should be promoted for the development of a healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from “cure-seeking medical care” to “cure- and support-seeking medical care,” the development of various comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In addition, it is important to strengthen industry–academia–government–private partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community.

A new quality management system of admittance indicators to improve industrial land use efficiency in the Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei region,Tian Y.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105456,22,False,Beijing Normal University,Beijing,China,"Given China's rapid urbanization, the continual adjustment of industrial land admittance indicators (ILAIs) to promote the optimal allocation and utilization of industrial land is critical for urban land use optimization and sustainable urban development. Unlike previous studies that have focused on qualitative analysis and traditional economic and statistical methods to modify ILAIs via sample survey data, this paper proposes a new theoretical framework for determining the optimal regulation of ILAIs to improve land use efficiency from a quality management perspective, analyses the differences in ILAIs in industrial space and types at multiple scales and sets and modifies the diverse function values of ILAIs by sub-region and sub-industrial sector via a probability model based on big data for 2007–2016 for the Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei (BTH) region. The findings were as follows: (1) The floor area ratio (FAR), greening ratio (GR), building density (BD) and fixed asset investment intensity (FAII) of industrial land in BTH were found to be low within national standards and exhibited great excavation potential. (2) The ILAIs exhibited spatial heterogeneity, with a significant multicore circular structure of peaks and fluctuations and with FAR, BD and FAII values higher in the Jing-Jin region and in the southern and northeastern regions of Hebei Province but lower in northwestern BTH, while the GR's spatial pattern showed the opposite trend. (3) Both the five classified sub-regions and industry sub-types displayed marked variations in ILAIs, indicating that it was necessary to modify ILAIs by sub-region and sub-industrial sector. (4) Industrial land use efficiency in BTH was further revealed at the general, non-intensive and extensive levels and was found to vary considerable by sub-type. The land use mode of the service industry was the most efficient and intensive, followed by that of the high-tech industry. The land intensiveness of various light industry sectors was clearly distinct, while the chemical, metallurgy and equipment manufacturing industries were of moderate to non-intensive levels. The lowest values were found for the mining and coking industry. (5) The probability model is suggested to be an effective method for modifying the multifunctional values of ILAIs. Relative to national standards, the improved control values of ILAIs were higher at the regional level, and for different sub-regions not fully proportional to their development levels, they were higher or lower than their regional counterparts, even deviating from national standards. The revised FAR of each industry was also found to be higher and directly proportional to existing national standards; however, their improvement exhibited the opposite trend. ILAIs performance was bifurcated in terms of industry sub-types and economic-geographic regions. This study suggests establishing twofold ILAIs of “land use efficiency and industrial development”, developing gradient path guidance for ILAIs threshold values and enhancing ILAIs implementation flexibility to realize the precise matching of industry transfer and acceptance and the coordinated and balanced development of the entire region and constructing a sound “access-adjustment-exit” circulation system for applying ILAIs throughout the life cycle of industrial land.","['mining', 'management', 'sets', 'classified', 'new', 'existing', 'hebei', 'use', 'chemical', 'method', 'beijingtianjinhebei', 'balanced', 'structure', 'vary', 'theoretical', 'intensive', 'improve', 'various', 'efficiency', 'five', 'distinct', 'grs', 'analyses', 'rapid', 'extensive', 'intensiveness', 'determining', 'revealed', 'suggests', 'marked', 'gr', 'twofold', 'entire', 'admittance', 'circular', 'relative', 'traditional', 'service', 'mode', 'modifies', 'multifunctional', 'revised', 'acceptance', 'subregion', 'opposite', 'bd', 'hightech', 'probability', 'levels', 'even', 'regions', 'directly', 'sustainable', 'jingjin', 'trend', 'proportional', 'effective', 'bth', 'flexibility', 'significant', 'manufacturing', 'sound', 'via', 'ratio', 'found', 'general', 'economicgeographic', 'ilais', 'economic', 'follows', 'higher', 'southern', 'guidance', 'showed', 'subregions', 'bifurcated', 'metallurgy', 'subtypes', 'space', 'modify', 'implementation', 'northeastern', 'clearly', 'unlike', 'terms', 'multiple', 'heterogeneity', 'types', 'developing', 'gradient', 'peaks', 'standards', 'continual', 'previous', 'allocation', 'variations', 'enhancing', 'precise', 'perspective', 'multicore', 'subtype', 'chinas', 'industries', 'great', 'greening', 'fluctuations', 'fixed', 'transfer', 'indicators', 'studies', 'national', 'improvement', 'sectors', 'matching', 'survey', 'excavation', 'utilization', 'necessary', 'circulation', 'urbanization', 'coordinated', 'optimization', 'considerable', 'function', 'intensity', 'lower', 'fully', 'nonintensive', 'constructing', 'within', 'cycle', 'proposes', 'path', 'scales', 'light', 'applying', 'deviating', 'land', 'low', 'establishing', 'northwestern', 'followed', 'industry', 'sample', 'control', 'realize', 'given', 'optimal', 'coking', 'focused', 'potential', 'area', 'adjustment', 'subindustrial', 'suggested', 'counterparts', 'indicating', 'sector', 'density', 'industrial', 'asset', 'accessadjustmentexit', 'critical', 'building', 'life', 'region', 'investment', 'far', 'quality', 'province', 'pattern', 'lowest', 'faii', 'modifying', 'diverse', 'different', 'efficient', 'throughout', 'improved', 'system', 'statistical', 'equipment', 'floor', 'exhibited', 'differences', 'moderate', 'level', 'qualitative', 'regional', 'promote', 'values', 'threshold', 'displayed', 'regulation']",2021,"[(1, 0.43663076), (3, 0.56293184)]"
Employment centers change faster than expected: An integrated identification method and application to Beijing,Huang D.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103224,8,False,Beijing Normal University,Beijing,China,"Traffic big data brings new opportunities for studying urban spatial structure. By using data from subway smart cards and road networks, as well as integrating travel chain analysis with route simulation and spatial statistical methods, this paper developed a methodological framework to identify employment centers quickly and objectively, through which both the form and attractive area of centers can be depicted. The validity and advantages of this novel method were verified in a Beijing case study. We identified four major combined employment centers with different dominant functions in the city center and one in a suburb as a new high-tech industrial zone. We deliberately chose an extremely short period to test the feasibility of the method. During that time, the employment centers remained stable in number, location, and size, which met our expectations. However, unexpected rapid changes were captured in the spatial form and attractive area or commuting pattern of employment centers. Specifically, we found an obvious suburbanization trend for employment centers, continuous evolution in a clear direction of every center's spatial form, and a commonly decreasing worker commuting distance in most centers over the one-year period.

A data-driven approach for origin–destination matrix construction from cellular network signalling data: a case study of Lyon region (France),Fekih M.,Transportation,10.1007/s11116-020-10108-w,32,False,Orange Labs,Issy-les-Moulineaux,France,"Spatiotemporal data, and more specifically origin–destination matrices, are critical inputs to mobility studies for transportation planning and urban management purposes. Traditionally, high-cost and hard-to-update household travel surveys are used to produce large-scale origin–destination flow information of individuals’ whereabouts. In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate origin–destination (O–D) matrices based on passively-collected cellular network signalling data of millions of anonymous mobile phone users in the Rhône-Alpes region, France. Unlike Call Detail Record (CDR) data which rely only on phone usage, signalling data include all network-based records providing higher spatiotemporal granularity. The explored dataset, which consists of time-stamped traces from 2G and 3G cellular networks with users’ unique identifier and cell tower locations, is used to first analyse the cell phone activity degree indicators of each user in order to qualify the mobility information involved in these records. These indicators serve as filtering criteria to identify users whose device transactions are sufficiently distributed over the analysed period to allow studying their mobility. Trips are then extracted from the spatiotemporal traces of users for whom the home location could be detected. Trips have been derived based on a minimum stationary time assumption that enables to determine activity (stop) zones for each user. As a large, but still partial, fraction of the population is observed, scaling is required to obtain an O–D matrix for the full population. We propose a method to perform this scaling and we show that signalling data-based O–D matrix carries similar estimations as those that can be obtained via travel surveys.","['rhônealpes', 'management', 'consists', 'origindestination', 'large', 'filtering', 'matrices', 'method', 'enables', 'allow', 'users', 'time', 'providing', 'od', 'transactions', 'household', 'estimations', 'whose', 'stationary', 'observed', 'stop', 'carries', 'databased', 'explored', 'granularity', 'similar', 'minimum', 'networkbased', 'serve', 'cell', 'tower', 'millions', 'france', 'location', 'identifier', 'population', 'matrix', 'anonymous', 'dataset', 'criteria', 'via', 'distributed', 'specifically', 'estimate', 'individuals', 'signalling', 'higher', 'call', 'could', 'network', 'traditionally', 'usage', 'full', 'record', 'degree', 'determine', 'propose', 'highcost', 'include', 'unlike', 'qualify', 'detected', 'cdr', 'detail', 'trips', 'traces', 'user', 'hardtoupdate', 'show', 'largescale', 'analysed', 'records', 'partial', 'required', 'obtained', 'studies', 'indicators', 'order', 'passivelycollected', 'transportation', 'produce', 'fraction', 'obtain', 'assumption', 'travel', 'inputs', 'surveys', 'still', 'unique', 'zones', 'methodology', 'mobile', 'phone', 'locations', 'purposes', 'mobility', 'networks', 'extracted', 'flow', 'device', 'involved', 'perform', 'sufficiently', 'cellular', 'home', 'critical', 'first', 'region', 'spatiotemporal', 'identify', 'studying', 'period', 'analyse', 'scaling', 'rely', 'whereabouts', 'timestamped', 'activity', 'derived']",2021,"[(1, 0.9988358)]"

Three decades of research on smart cities: Mapping knowledge structure and trends,Sharifi A.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su13137140,59,True,Hiroshima University,Higashihiroshima,Japan,"The concept of smart cities has gained significant momentum in science and policy circles over the past decade. This study aims to provide an overview of the structure and trends in the literature on smart cities.

In addition to providing insights into the thematic evolution of the field, the three-decade study period is divided into two sub-periods (1991–2015 and 2016–2021). While splitting the dataset into more sub-periods would have been desirable, we decided to only examine two sub-periods as only very few papers have been published until 2010. The annual number of publications has progressively increased since then, with a surge in the annual number of publications observable from 2015 onwards. The thematic analysis showed that the intellectual base of the field has been very limited during the first period, but has expanded significantly since 2015. Over time, some thematic evolutions, such as further attention to linkages to climate change and resilience, and more emphasis on security and privacy issues, have been made. The thematic analysis shows that existing research on smart cities is dominated by either conceptual issues or underlying technical aspects. It is, therefore, essential to do more research on the implementation of smart cities and actual and/or potential contributions of smart cities to solving societal issues.

This paper aims to identify the differences of multi-mechanisms driving fine-scale urban land use expansion based on big data and machine learning, in the Huizhou downtown area in 2000–2015. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to identify the natural, transportation, location, social, and POI factors driving land expansion by considering different urban land-use categories. Our RF estimations showed that enormous differences existed between various urban land-use types in terms of the role they played in this expansion and their relation to potential determinants, during the different urban development stages studied. Transportation, location, and the distribution of actual land use were found to exert a greater influence on urban land expansion than other factors. All the findings above provide detailed spatiotemporal knowledge and targeted information that can aid in understanding fine-scale urban land use dynamics. In this way, sound planning strategies for different fine-scale land uses can be formulated more scientifically.

Compared with the results obtained from large American urban areas, our regression results imply that population alone accounts for most of the variation in the polycentric index and that commuting costs provide a weak explanation of the existence of Chinese PLACMDs. Both economic development and agglomeration economics are associated with the polycentric index.

A new data-enabled intelligence framework for evaluating urban space perception,Ji H.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi10060400,19,True,Sichuan University,Chengdu,China,"The urban environment has a great impact on the wellbeing of citizens and it is of great significance to understand how citizens perceive and evaluate places in a large scale urban region and to provide scientific evidence to support human-centered urban planning with a better urban environment. Existing studies for assessing urban perception have primarily relied on low efficiency methods, which also result in low evaluation accuracy. Furthermore, there lacks a sophisticated understanding on how to correlate the urban perception with the built environment and other socio-economic data, which limits their applications in supporting urban planning. In this study, a new data-enabled intelligence framework for evaluating human perceptions of urban space is proposed. Specifically, a novel classification-then-regression strategy based on a deep convolutional neural network and a random-forest algorithm is proposed. The proposed approach has been applied to evaluate the perceptions of Beijing and Chengdu against six perceptual criteria. Meanwhile, multi-source data were employed to investigate the associations between human perceptions and the indicators for the built environment and socio-economic data including visual elements, facility attributes and socio-economic indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively evaluate urban perceptions.

The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Activity resilience presents a composite spatial structure of circles and clusters, and most areas are resilient but at a low level. 2) There are significantly positive and negative global autocorrelation between activity resilience and activity scale, and activity stability. Simultaneously, there also exists a local spatial autocorrelation with the opposite positive and negative trends. 3) Activity environment has a significant effect on activity resilience, and the degree and direction of influence among different dimensions and regions are heterogeneous. 4) For activity resilience, it is necessary to increase the matching degree between the scale and stability of activities, and reduce the excessive concentration and flow of activities.

Evaluation of Spatial Matching between Urban Green Space and Population: Dynamics Analysis of Winter Population Data in Xi'an,Li J.,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000685,12,False,Northwest University,Xi'an,China,"From the perspective of city dynamics, the spatial matching relationships between urban green space (UGS) and population are of great significance to the construction of an eco-livable city. In this study, Xi'an was taken as an example based on the big data of Google images and a Baidu heat map. The spatial matching relationships between UGS and the population were explored by using the coupled coordination model through the service capability index and population density index. The results show that there is a higher coupling degree, a lower coordination degree, and a larger spatiotemporal heterogeneity in coordination type between UGS and population in Xi'an. The reason for this is that many factors including urban spatial structure, expansion mode, functional differentiation, distribution pattern of large-scale ruins and relic sites, and urban planning management and control each have significant impacts on the spatial matching between UGS and population. Therefore, for the dense urban habitat, it is necessary not only to consider the spatial differences of job-housing and urban location conditions but also to actively protect the existing UGS, improve its accessibility, and enhance its quality. The dynamic evaluation of spatial matching between UGS and population is based on big data, which can maximize the utility of UGS resources in the dense urban habitat and provide theoretical guidance for spatial optimization, planning, and design.","['green', 'management', 'coupled', 'existing', 'protect', 'structure', 'relationships', 'theoretical', 'improve', 'map', 'therefore', 'heat', 'relic', 'conditions', 'service', 'explored', 'mode', 'resources', 'including', 'location', 'population', 'differentiation', 'significant', 'enhance', 'dynamic', 'provide', 'habitat', 'higher', 'guidance', 'xian', 'accessibility', 'space', 'degree', 'jobhousing', 'heterogeneity', 'index', 'expansion', 'show', 'utility', 'largescale', 'maximize', 'perspective', 'baidu', 'type', 'great', 'sites', 'ugs', 'coordination', 'actively', 'matching', 'factors', 'dense', 'necessary', 'optimization', 'lower', 'control', 'dynamics', 'google', 'city', 'distribution', 'capability', 'coupling', 'consider', 'larger', 'impacts', 'example', 'construction', 'density', 'ruins', 'functional', 'ecolivable', 'reason', 'pattern', 'spatiotemporal', 'quality', 'significance', 'differences', 'taken', 'images', 'many']",2021,"[(1, 0.9982708)]"
Understanding urban centers in Shanghai with big data: Local and non-local function perspectives,Yan L.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2021.103156,16,False,Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology,Singapore City,Singapore,"Along with the rising space-of-flow, non-local functions are identified as a comparable force to local urban-hinterland relations that determine urban development. However, little evidence and explanation have been presented for how urban centers (UCs) are made of local and non-local functions. By examining the case of Shanghai, this paper endeavors to fill the gap with multiple big/open datasets. We first identify UCs using a new method as well as employment/activity densities inferred from cell phone data. Then, local and non-local forces are measured using functional and interaction metrics derived from theoretical deduction based on classic economic-space theories. Our result demonstrates that non-local functions have become a comparable force as local functions. Spatial analyses show that non-local functions generally agglomerate in about 30 UCs (27%) in the inner-ring Puxi area, presumably indicating a locational preference for local services and demand; local functions are distributed more like the central places diagram in Isard (1956). Additionally, specialization analysis of UCs shows clear evidence that non-local functions cause both centralization and decentralization in UCs, which can be well explained by the deductive theoretical patterns.

Modern reurbanization is an emergent phenomenon that occurs in cities that experienced urban shrinkage in the past decades. Urban policies proposed to the “new” regrowing cities should meet challenges of old shrinking consequences and new regrowing demands. Nowadays, policy-makers need to hear the voice from different age groups, some use new, non-traditional media in policy debates. Online media data has the potential to provide quasi-live feedbacks, to supply the traditional opinion surveys.

Location selection and correlation characteristics of chain stores against the background of new retail,Zhang Y.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003353,3,False,East China Normal University,Shanghai,China,"Research on the spatial relationship of retail activities is a hot topic in urban geography. With the continuous upgrade of Internet technology, the development mode of business has evolved from the traditional retail model into the e-commerce model, and now the new retail model. While the new retail model influences the locational decision-making behavior of enterprises, it also affects the intrinsic mechanism of attraction and avoidance among retail stores, which in turn affects the spatial association relationship of commercial retail. In such a context, we take the Starbucks, COSTA, and Luckin Coffee stores in Shanghai's inner ring as our research objects, and use a variety of spatial statistical methods and field research to analyze the spatial correlation characteristics among the three. The results show that, first, the spatial distribution of coffee stores under both traditional and new retail models generally exhibit the spatially oriented characteristics of being close to the consumer market. Therefore, it can be indirectly inferred that although Luckin Coffee, which is characterized by new retail, can create ""infinite space"" to meet consumers' consumption needs in different spaces by virtue of its own Internet development advantage, it remains difficult to completely break away from the spatial orientation of the offline consumption market. Second, in terms of spatial agglomeration, Starbucks' high sensitivity to specific consumer groups and its sales strategy of providing a comfortable environment have led the business to open stores in dense proximity in locations with high consumption potential, thus contributing to its strongest spatial agglomeration. Luckin Coffee, by contrast, has a certain degree of flexibility in choosing store locations due to its independent instant delivery service, and in order to occupy a wider market as soon as possible, it chooses store locations in favor of uniform coverage, resulting in the weakest degree of spatial agglomeration. Third, based on multivariate spatial statistics, it can be seen that Starbucks, COSTA, and Luckin coffee stores all exhibit positive spatial relationship characteristics in the two corresponding spatial relationships. Among them, traditional coffee retailers Starbucks and COSTA show a more obvious spatial relationship of mutual attraction, indicating that both can increase their market shares by converting the fierce price competition between them into an attraction drive to increase their total profits. At the same time, the stores of traditional retailer Starbucks and new retailer Luckin Coffee also show a significant spatial relationship of mutual attraction in space, indicating that the market share effect dominates. Finally, micro-location analysis reveals that Starbucks and COSTA stores have a stronger mutual attraction relationship and often appear in pairs in the center of shopping districts or business areas, while Luckin Coffee stores are often located in ""non-central"" areas. As a representative of new retail, Luckin Coffee can make up for its location disadvantage to a certain extent by virtue of its mobile application online service and instant delivery service. The store can also utilize its Internet platform, big data analysis, and other technical advantages, so that it can combine its own product positioning characteristics when choosing store locations, and accurately find potential store locations and opening models. Therefore, when carrying out urban planning, especially the planning of commercial areas, attention should be paid to the impact of the new retail model on location selection, the role of the Internet, and big data in location decision making. The development possibilities of traditionally weaker locations should be explored, and the efficiency of urban land use should be improved.","['models', 'strongest', 'new', 'consumers', 'meet', 'use', 'relationship', 'high', 'wider', 'analyze', 'decisionmaking', 'consumption', 'dominates', 'open', 'hot', 'relationships', 'making', 'inferred', 'time', 'virtue', 'providing', 'efficiency', 'ring', 'therefore', 'completely', 'continuous', 'positioning', 'shanghais', 'weakest', 'finally', 'corresponding', 'generally', 'carrying', 'traditional', 'correlation', 'service', 'mode', 'exhibit', 'located', 'explored', 'positive', 'retailers', 'spatially', 'second', 'two', 'fierce', 'role', 'profits', 'location', 'selection', 'three', 'flexibility', 'significant', 'technology', 'weaker', 'converting', 'evolved', 'due', 'shares', 'appear', 'retailer', 'multivariate', 'mutual', 'utilize', 'find', 'characterized', 'offline', 'traditionally', 'geography', 'space', 'degree', 'areas', 'strategy', 'led', 'take', 'terms', 'intrinsic', 'product', 'microlocation', 'ecommerce', 'independent', 'possibilities', 'indirectly', 'show', 'representative', 'accurately', 'seen', 'behavior', 'luckin', 'internet', 'remains', 'orientation', 'coffee', 'inner', 'reveals', 'contrast', 'price', 'order', 'break', 'dense', 'occupy', 'instant', 'coverage', 'center', 'extent', 'enterprises', 'difficult', 'specific', 'resulting', 'statistics', 'association', 'advantages', 'shopping', 'increase', 'locational', 'create', 'online', 'disadvantage', 'obvious', 'third', 'agglomeration', 'advantage', 'activities', 'spaces', 'sensitivity', 'land', 'needs', 'comfortable', 'turn', 'close', 'commercial', 'favor', 'total', 'context', 'objects', 'variety', 'certain', 'opening', 'distribution', 'groups', 'competition', 'platform', 'store', 'technical', 'attention', 'choosing', 'upgrade', 'mobile', 'influences', 'locations', 'potential', 'business', 'infinite', 'sales', 'chooses', 'indicating', 'characteristics', 'noncentral', 'uniform', 'attraction', 'proximity', 'market', 'affects', 'stores', 'costa', 'field', 'first', 'share', 'combine', 'oriented', 'different', 'delivery', 'consumer', 'possible', 'mechanism', 'effect', 'retail', 'avoidance', 'although', 'thus', 'improved', 'topic', 'pairs', 'among', 'statistical', 'stronger', 'contributing', 'away', 'districts', 'make', 'paid', 'environment', 'starbucks', 'soon', 'often', 'especially', 'decision', 'drive']",2021,"[(0, 0.956818), (1, 0.04266424)]"

Inferring urban land use from multi-source urban mobility data using latent multi-view subspace clustering,Liu Q.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi10050274,9,True,Central South University,Changsha,China,"In the era of big data, vast urban mobility data introduce new opportunities to infer urban land use from the perspective of social function. Most existing works only derive land use information from a single type of urban mobility dataset, which is typically biased and results in difficulty obtaining a comprehensive view of urban land use. It remains challenging to fuse highdimensional and noisy multi-source urban mobility data to infer urban land use. This study aimed to infer urban land use from multi-source urban mobility data using latent multi-view subspace clustering. The variation in the number of origin/destination points over time was initially used to characterize land use types. Then, a latent multi-view representation was applied to construct the common underlying structure shared by multi-source urban mobility data and effectively deal with noise. Finally, based on the latent multi-view representation, the subspace clustering method was used to infer the land use types. Experiments on taxi trajectory data and bus smart card data in Beijing reveal that, compared with the method using a single type of urban mobility dataset and the weighted fusion method, the approach presented in this study obtains the highest detection rate of land use.

A proposed framework for identification of indicators to model high-frequency cities,Senousi A.M.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi10050317,6,True,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"A city is a complex system that never sleeps; it constantly changes, and its internal mobility (people, vehicles, goods, information, etc.) continues to accelerate and intensify. These changes and mobility vary in terms of the attributes of the city, such as space, time and cultural affiliation, which characterise to some extent how the city functions. Traditional urban studies have successfully modelled the ‘low-frequency city’ and have provided solutions such as urban planning and highway design for long-term urban development. Nevertheless, the existing urban studies and theories are insufficient to model the dynamics of a city’s intense mobility and rapid changes, so they cannot tackle short-term urban problems such as traffic congestion, real-time transport scheduling and resource management. The advent of information and communication technology and big data presents opportunities to model cities with unprecedented resolution. Since 2018, a paradigm shift from modelling the ‘low-frequency city’ to the so-called ‘high-frequency city’ has been introduced, but hardly any research investigated methods to estimate a city’s frequency. This work aims to propose a framework for the identification and analysis of indicators to model and better understand the concept of a high-frequency city in a systematic manner. The methodology for this work was based on a content analysis-based review, taking into account specific criteria to ensure the selection of indicator sets that are consistent with the concept of the frequency of cities. Twenty-two indicators in five groups were selected as indicators for a high-frequency city, and a framework was proposed to assess frequency at both the intra-city and inter-city levels.

Beyond absolute space: An exploration of relative and relational space in Shanghai using taxi trajectory data,Li X.,Journal of Transport Geography,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103076,8,False,College of Arts &amp; Sciences,Chapel Hill,United States,"The nature of urban space has long-drawn geographers' interest and David Harvey's conceptual framework of multiple spaces (i.e., absolute, relative, and relational) within cities has been widely adopted and developed. With its high spatial and temporal resolution, geospatial big data plays an increasingly important role in our understanding of urban structure. Taxi trajectory data is particularly useful in travel purpose estimation and allows for more granular insights into urban mobility due to the door-to-door nature of these trips. This article utilizes taxi trajectory data and explores the interaction among absolute space, relative space, and relational space in Harvey's framework using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Through an empirical study of Shanghai's downtown area, this paper highlights the importance of Harvey's framework in understanding cities' dynamic structure and argues for changes in urban planning and development to better coordinate land use and travel demand. We find an insignificant relationship between relative and relational space in Shanghai due to a mismatch between urban mobility and the built environment. This mismatch concentrates the transportation flow near the city's core area, transforming the polycentric structure of Shanghai's built environment in absolute space to a single-node structure in relational space. After identifying the contributing factors to this problem in Shanghai, this article suggests combining Harvey's conceptual framework of multiple spaces with geospatial big data to inform planning strategies that address the challenges of rapid urbanization.","['adopted', 'developed', 'transforming', 'structural', 'use', 'relationship', 'high', 'nature', 'ie', 'structure', 'geographers', 'inform', 'shanghais', 'mismatch', 'rapid', 'suggests', 'cities', 'relative', 'downtown', 'insights', 'core', 'role', 'temporal', 'identifying', 'combining', 'modeling', 'geospatial', 'harveys', 'demand', 'increasingly', 'singlenode', 'dynamic', 'due', 'equation', 'highlights', 'find', 'empirical', 'space', 'problem', 'multiple', 'challenges', 'better', 'estimation', 'trips', 'interaction', 'argues', 'david', 'absolute', 'important', 'importance', 'allows', 'relational', 'widely', 'strategies', 'trajectory', 'factors', 'transportation', 'urbanization', 'polycentric', 'built', 'taxi', 'useful', 'within', 'travel', 'particularly', 'citys', 'resolution', 'plays', 'spaces', 'land', 'changes', 'doortodoor', 'purpose', 'concentrates', 'sem', 'explores', 'coordinate', 'interest', 'area', 'address', 'mobility', 'flow', 'utilizes', 'near', 'longdrawn', 'conceptual', 'granular', 'shanghai', 'among', 'contributing', 'insignificant', 'environment']",2021,"[(1, 0.99849534)]"

Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning.

To understand the effects of activity space borders, this study first delineates the activity space borders and identifies the borders into three categories: natural, infrastructural, and administrative borders. Then, the border effect from three types of borders is evaluated through the spatial interaction model revealing their influence on intra-urban travel connections. On basis of the modeling results, we introduce an indicator, border thickness, to measure the distance increased caused by each border of activity space.

It has therefore become essential to understand how urban spatial structure changes, particularly with the increasingly available sources of ‘big data’. However, most studies mainly focus on delineating the spatial structure and its variations. Only a few have investigated the incentives behind the movement dynamics. To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels.","['community', 'become', 'patterns', 'structural', 'structure', 'movement', 'essential', 'various', 'five', 'therefore', 'investigated', 'smart', 'cities', 'strategic', 'policies', 'changing', 'compact', 'difficulties', 'thirdly', 'levels', 'communities', 'increasingly', 'affected', 'secondly', 'londons', 'towards', 'detection', 'found', 'respectively', 'understand', 'applies', 'network', 'addition', 'areas', 'residential', 'terms', 'differ', 'interaction', 'variations', 'years', 'show', 'london', 'clusters', 'card', 'mainly', 'studies', 'indicators', 'coevolves', 'factors', 'clustered', 'available', 'polycentric', 'socioeconomic', 'intensity', 'main', 'moved', 'delineating', 'travel', 'particularly', 'motivation', 'changes', 'develop', 'densities', 'uncertainties', 'dynamics', 'employment', 'policy', 'passengers', 'firstly', 'continuing', 'potential', 'behind', 'grappling', 'density', 'characteristics', 'focus', 'pattern', 'identify', 'uncover', 'different', 'londoners', 'incentives', 'change', 'sources', 'greater', 'derived']",2021,"[(0, 0.34247708), (1, 0.6563325)]"

Assessing geographical representativeness of crowdsourced urban mobility data: An empirical investigation of Australian bicycling,Lieske S.N.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/2399808319894334,5,False,The University of Queensland,Brisbane,Australia,"In an era of data-driven smart cities, the possibility of using crowdsourced big data to support evidence-based planning and decision-making remains a challenge. Along with the increased availability and potential utility of crowdsourced data, there is a clear need to assess the validity of these data in order to determine their appropriate use for planning and management. Moreover, with growth and rapid urbanization in many cities, there are increasing challenges associated with urban mobility. The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the geographical representativeness of crowdsourced data in the context of urban mobility through investigation of bicycling in Australian cities. In order to leverage both the geographic distribution and high volume of crowdsourced data for validity assessment, we present a two-stage statistical approach. First, we evaluate flow data through correlation between spatial interaction matrices in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. The second stage evaluates the quantity of information available within the interaction matrices. The approach is demonstrated with crowdsourced bicycling commuting routes recorded by the RiderLog app from 2010 to 2014 that are then correlated with census bicycling journey to work data. Data are from four of Australia’s state capital cities: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. These methods assess the representativeness of individual bicycle routes that address the full pattern of flows within multiorigin multidestination systems and incorporate spatial autocorrelation. Results indicate that these crowdsourced data are geographically representative of regional travel where there are higher data volumes, generally in central business districts and occasionally in outlying areas. This research provides insights into both methods for statistical comparison of flow data and the use of crowdsourced bicycling routes for urban planning and management.","['goal', 'management', 'systems', 'use', 'matrices', 'high', 'decisionmaking', 'melbourne', 'geographical', 'associated', 'assess', 'quantity', 'rapid', 'datadriven', 'twostage', 'smart', 'cities', 'generally', 'present', 'correlation', 'flows', 'outlying', 'insights', 'possibility', 'second', 'evidencebased', 'comparison', 'stage', 'app', 'four', 'need', 'incorporate', 'challenge', 'higher', 'central', 'evaluates', 'full', 'recorded', 'areas', 'clear', 'determine', 'presence', 'capital', 'provides', 'availability', 'challenges', 'interaction', 'occasionally', 'brisbane', 'along', 'journey', 'utility', 'autocorrelation', 'representative', 'growth', 'leverage', 'remains', 'australian', 'commuting', 'multidestination', 'geographically', 'order', 'adelaide', 'urbanization', 'available', 'australias', 'within', 'geographic', 'travel', 'era', 'increased', 'increasing', 'multiorigin', 'bicycle', 'context', 'develop', 'bicycling', 'work', 'individual', 'perth', 'distribution', 'demonstrated', 'representativeness', 'investigation', 'potential', 'address', 'mobility', 'business', 'flow', 'volume', 'crowdsourced', 'riderlog', 'first', 'appropriate', 'pattern', 'evaluate', 'validity', 'routes', 'support', 'state', 'indicate', 'districts', 'moreover', 'statistical', 'correlated', 'regional', 'volumes', 'many', 'census']",2021,"[(1, 0.2979458), (3, 0.70127684)]"

What’s more, the following main conclusions are obtained: the high-risk areas of the epidemic are mainly concentrated in the areas with relatively dense permanent population and floating population, which means that the permanent population and floating population are the main factors affecting the risk level of the epidemic. In other words, the reasonable control of population density is greatly conducive to reducing the risk level of the epidemic.

Spatial match between residents’daily life circle and public service facilities using big data analytics: A case of beijing,Zhao P.,Progress in Geography,10.18306/dlkxjz.2021.04.001,34,True,Peking University,Beijing,China,"Residents' daily life circle is one of the key issues in relation to the national spatial planning in the ""new era"". Supply of public service facilities is the primary condition for plan-making of this type of circle. Spatial match between residents' daily life circle and public service facilities reveals the human-environment relationship at the community level. There exist many studies on spatial match between residents' daily life circle and public service facilities. However, the existing findings are mainly based on survey data, which have disadvantages such as insufficient samples, small geography coverage, and so on. This study investigated the spatial match between residents' daily life circle and public service facilities in large cities by taking Beijing as an example. Using mobile phone data and point-of-interest (POI) data collected in 2018, this study measured the spatial range of residents' daily life circle and accessibility of public service facilities, and analyzed the relationship between the spatial range of residents' daily life circle and accessibility of public service facilities by the bivariate spatial autocorrelation method. It also analyzed the geographical variations in the relationship. The results of analysis show that residents' daily life circle has a multi-centric structure at the city level. The length of radius of the circle increases from the central areas to the periphery. Accessibility of public service facilities is featured with a zonal structure but its level decreases with the distance away from the centers. The level of accessibility is negatively related with radius of the circle, which means that the higher level of accessibility, the smaller radius of the circle. There are geographical variations in the relationship. The relationship is ""high-low"" in the city center and new town centers, but dominated by ""low-low"" and ""low-high"" pattern in the fringe of the city center and new town centers. There are also variations in the relationship between different types of public service facilities. For the cultural and leisure facilities, the degree of spatial match between residents' daily life circle and public service facilities is obvious lower than other facilities.

Takis Zenetos’s Electronic Urbanism and Tele-Activities: Minimizing Transportation as Social Aspiration,Charitonidou M.,Urban Science,10.3390/urbansci5010031,4,True,ETH Zürich,Zurich,Switzerland,"Takis Zenetos was enthusiastic about the idea of working from home, and believed that both architecture and urban planning should be reshaped in order to respond to this. He supported the design of special public spaces in residential units, aiming to accommodate the inhabitants during working hours. This article argues that Zenetos’s design for “Electronic Urbanism” was more prophetic, and more pragmatic, than his peers such as Archigram and Constant Nieuwenhuys. Despite the fact that they shared an optimism towards technological developments and megastructure, a main difference between Zenetos’s view and the perspectives of his peers is his rejection of a generalised enthusiasm concerning increasing mobility of people. In opposition with Archigram, Zenetos insisted in minimizing citizens’ mobility and supported the replacement of daily transport with the use advanced information technologies, using terms such as “tele-activity”. Zenetos was convinced that “Electronic Urbanism” would help citizens save the time that they normally used to commute to work, and would allow them to spend this time on more creative activities, at or near their homes. The main interest of “Electronic Urbanism” lies in the fact that it not only constitutes an artistic contribution to experimental architecture, but is also characterized by a new social vision, promising to resynchronize practices of daily life. An aspect that is also examined is the relationship of Zenetos’s ideas and those of the so-called Metabolists in the 1960s in Japan, including Kenzo Tange’s conception of megastructures.

"Public transport availability and healthcare use for Australian adults aged 18–60 years, with and without disabilities",Badji S.,Journal of Transport and Health,10.1016/j.jth.2020.101001,13,False,Monash University,Melbourne,Australia,"Introduction: Public transport (PT) availability may be more important for people with disabilities (PWD), as typically they have greater healthcare needs and mobility barriers compared with people without disabilities. This paper investigates how PT availability is associated with healthcare use for people aged 18–60 years, with and without disabilities in Australia. Method: We used unique Australian healthcare use administrative data linked to the 2016 Census, where individuals report whether they have a disability (severe or profound core activity limitation). These data were merged with detailed information on local area PT availability for Australia's 21 largest cities. We estimated regression models to examine the association between PT availability and different types of healthcare use, while controlling for individual characteristics and larger area attributes. Results: PT availability was positively associated with visits to general practitioners (GP), with a higher magnitude observed for people with disabilities (PWD). While people without disabilities had on average 0.1 more GP visits per year when PT availability was high compared with low, PWD on average visited their GP 0.5 more times per year if they lived in areas with high as opposed to low PT availability. Nervous system prescriptions (which includes antidepressants) were 0.27 per year fewer for PWD living in areas with high compared with low PT availability. Conversely, nervous system scripts were 0.06 higher for people without disability with high compared with low PT availability. Conclusion: We conclude that PT availability is likely to be a key factor of healthcare use. Increasing PT availability may help overcome some barriers to healthcare use for PWD. Our findings are also consistent with PT increasing access to preventive care, which may reduce the severity or better management of illnesses. PT can play an important role in improving health and decreasing health inequalities between those with and without disabilities.","['models', 'aged', 'management', 'introduction', 'use', 'method', 'preventive', 'high', 'controlling', 'positively', 'severity', 'associated', 'healthcare', 'reduce', 'limitation', 'cities', 'observed', 'likely', 'core', 'largest', 'australia', 'role', 'nervous', 'opposed', 'practitioners', 'barriers', 'administrative', 'profound', 'severe', 'disability', 'whether', 'per', 'general', 'individuals', 'higher', 'typically', 'fewer', 'times', 'may', 'decreasing', 'factor', 'pt', 'areas', 'transport', 'access', 'availability', 'average', 'better', 'types', 'scripts', 'years', 'visited', 'conclusion', 'pwd', 'public', 'important', 'australian', 'regression', 'lived', 'merged', 'magnitude', 'compared', 'inequalities', 'report', 'care', 'local', 'key', 'attributes', 'health', 'association', 'includes', 'australias', 'year', 'detailed', 'overcome', 'people', 'low', 'needs', 'increasing', 'unique', 'disabilities', 'living', 'conversely', 'individual', 'estimated', 'larger', 'examine', 'gp', 'help', 'area', 'mobility', 'linked', 'illnesses', 'characteristics', 'without', 'consistent', 'improving', 'antidepressants', 'play', 'different', 'investigates', 'system', 'greater', 'conclude', 'activity', 'visits', 'census', 'prescriptions']",2021,"[(1, 0.20141505), (3, 0.7978004)]"
Towards a multidimensional view of tourist mobility patterns in cities: A mobile phone data perspective,Xu Y.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101593,42,False,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"The last decade has witnessed a wealth of studies on characterizing human mobility patterns using movement datasets. Such efforts have highlighted a few salient dimensions of individual travel behavior relevant to urban planning and policy analysis. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, most of the findings are drawn upon urban residents. The behavioral characteristics of other population groups, such as tourists, remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework to gain insights into tourist mobility patterns. By analyzing mobile phone trajectories of international travelers to three different cities in South Korea, we introduce nine mobility indicators to capture different facets of tourist travel behavior (e.g., duration of stay in a city, spatial extent of activities, location visited and trips conducted, and mobility diversity), and examine their statistical properties across cities. An eigendecomposition approach is then introduced to better understand the interdependency of these mobility indicators and inherent variations among individual travelers. Based on the eigendecomposition results, we further employ a dimension reduction technique to describe the key characteristics of each traveler. Since the mobile phone dataset captures the nationality of tourists, we use such information to quantify the behavioral heterogeneity of travelers across countries and regions. Finally, we select a few traveler groups with distinctive mobility patterns in each city and examine the spatial patterns of their activities. Substantial differences are observed among traveler groups in their spatial preferences. The implications for location recommendation and deployment of tourism services (e.g., transportation) are discussed. We hope the study brings a synergy between classic human mobility analysis and the emerging field of tourism big data.

This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning.

In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia.

This model is based on the assumption that the temporal activity patterns of places lie in a high-dimensional space and can be represented by a union of low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces are obtained through finding sparse representations using the data science method known as sparse subspace clustering (SSC).

It posits that the current digital technology age has a drastic impact on city strategies and calls for a multi-faceted perspective on future urban development, termed here the ‘XXQ-principle’ (which seeks to attain the highest possible level of quality for urban life). Heterogeneity in urban objectives and data embodied in the XXQ-principle can be systematically addressed by a process of data decomposition (based on a ‘cascade principle’), so that first, higher-level urban policy domains are equipped with the necessary (‘big’) data provisions, followed by lower-ranking urban governance levels. The conceptual decomposition principle can then be translated into a comprehensive hierarchical model architecture for urban intelligence based on the ‘flying disc’ model, including key performance indicators (KPIs). This new model maps out the socio-economic arena of a complex urban system according to the above cascade system. The design of this urban system architecture and the complex mutual connections between its subsystems is based on the ‘blowing-up’ principle that originates from a methodological deconstruction-reconstruction paradigm in the social sciences. The paper advocates the systematic application of this principle to enhance the performance of smart cities, called the XXQ performance value. This study is not empirical, although it is inspired by a wealth of previous empirical research. It aims to advance conceptual and methodological thinking on principles of smart urban planning.","['intelligence', 'provisions', 'posits', 'new', 'social', 'aims', 'systematic', 'sciences', 'embodied', 'deconstructionreconstruction', 'blowingup', 'datadriven', 'seeks', 'smart', 'cities', 'systematically', 'objectives', 'cascade', 'inspired', 'termed', 'including', 'levels', 'arena', 'datarich', 'complex', 'decomposition', 'whether', 'technology', 'equipped', 'enhance', 'need', 'principle', 'addressed', 'xxq', 'kpis', 'mutual', 'advance', 'drastic', 'empirical', 'translated', 'heterogeneity', 'higherlevel', 'previous', 'value', 'underpinning', 'perspective', 'advocates', 'digital', 'called', 'principles', 'indicators', 'strategies', 'disc', 'xxqprinciple', 'key', 'necessary', 'socioeconomic', 'connections', 'attain', 'paradigm', 'provided', 'wealth', 'reassessment', 'methodological', 'subsystems', 'practices', 'according', 'followed', 'age', 'originates', 'thinking', 'background', 'highest', 'city', 'policy', 'governance', 'comprehensive', 'address', 'contemporary', 'domains', 'calls', 'hierarchical', 'multifaceted', 'architecture', 'life', 'prompts', 'first', 'appropriate', 'conceptual', 'quality', 'maps', 'possible', 'current', 'although', 'future', 'flying', 'system', 'lowerranking', 'level', 'question']",2021,"[(2, 0.99819565)]"

Furthermore, this study aimed to describe daily urban rhythms in terms of human mobility. For these purposes, we constructed a GIS microscope by handling our geo-tagged big data based on the person-trip data. Through a multi-view study, we affirmed that the spatiotemporal mobility patterns had a certain consistency at different scales. Results suggested that the human mobility patterns expressed a typical inter-regional functional complementarity and a certain daily rhythm under the layout of TMA's quadruple concentric ring structure.

From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior.

Analyzing Asymmetric City Connectivity by Toponym on Social Media in China,Ye X.,Chinese Geographical Science,10.1007/s11769-020-1172-6,7,True,Texas A&amp;M University,College Station,United States,"The connectedness between cities has become one of the most widely discussed topics in urban and regional research in the mobile and big data era. One problem identified is the asymmetric city connectivity, partially due to data availability. We present a data-driven approach based on location and toponym (place name) extracted from social media data, to assess the asymmetric connectivity between cities. The assumption is that a higher frequency of occurrences of the name of city i in posts located in city j would imply that the city i is more influential than other cities upon city j. In addition, we’ve developed a group of measurements such as the relatedness index, impact index, link strength index, dependence index, and structure similar index to characterize such interactions. This framework of connectivity measurements can also be used to support smart planning taking into account the evolving interplay among cities.

Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning.

Modelling urban change with cellular automata: Contemporary issues and future research directions,Liu Y.,Progress in Human Geography,10.1177/0309132519895305,60,False,The University of Queensland,Brisbane,Australia,"The study of land use change in urban and regional systems has been dramatically transformed in the last four decades by the emergence and application of cellular automata (CA) models. CA models simulate urban land use changes which evolve from the bottom-up. Despite notable achievements in this field, there remain significant gaps between urban processes simulated in CA models and the actual dynamics of evolving urban systems. This article identifies contemporary issues faced in developing urban CA models and draws on this evidence to map out four interrelated thematic areas that require concerted attention by the wider CA urban modelling community. These are: (1) to build models that comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional processes of urban change, including urban regeneration, densification and gentrification, in-fill development, as well as urban shrinkage and vertical urban growth; (2) to establish models that incorporate individual human decision behaviours into the CA analytic framework; (3) to draw on emergent sources of ‘big data’ to calibrate and validate urban CA models and to capture the role of human actors and their impact on urban change dynamics; and (4) to strengthen theory-based CA models that comprehensively explain urban change mechanisms and dynamics.

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli's ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs's figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution.

Development of hyperspectral imaging remote sensing technology,Liu Y.,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,10.11834/jrs.20210283,31,True,Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences,Shanghai,China,"Hyperspectral remote sensing technology can acquire an object's geometric, radiation, and spectral information. This technology is an important technique in Earth observations and is increasingly becoming important in applications of natural resource survey, environment and disaster monitoring, precision agriculture, oceans and costal monitoring, and urban planning. In the past decades, several advanced hyperspectral imaging systems from airborne (e.g., AVIRIS, Hymap, OMIS, and PHI) to spaceborne (e.g., EO-1/Hyperion and PROBA/CHRIS) platforms have been designed, built, and operated globally. On the one hand, airborne hyperspectral imager has been developed into commercial operation stage. Examples of international companies that develop airborne systems are Spectra Vista Corporation of America, Specim of Finland, and ITRES Research of Canada. On the other hand, GF-5/AHSI, which is a pioneer in Chinese spaceborne hyperspectral imager, has first realized wide spectrum, wide swath width, and high detection sensitivity. It marks a new era ever since the appearance of EO-1/Hyperion in 2000. In the future, the outlook for hyperspectral remote sensing technique is as follows: (1) The development of large-scale plane array detector, optical machining detection, and signal processing has improved not only the spectral resolution but also the spatial resolution and swath width of hyperspectral imaging. Hyperspectral imager's spectrum range will cover from UV to LWIR to obtain more abundant spectral information of ground objects, all-day reflectance, and emission spectral characteristics. In addition, the integrated calibration methods of laboratory, in-orbit, and the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the cold air, and the stars are becoming increasingly abundant and refined to ensure the application efficiency of hyperspectral imager at higher performance. The hyperspectral imaging technology with super wide width and higher resolution also puts forward higher requirements for the further development of large-scale detectors and large-aperture optics with wide working band range. (2) The development of information, imaging, and optical processing technology has introduced new beam splitting technologies and developed the core beam splitting elements from the mature dispersion and interference type to the diversified direction. Many novel optical splitting schemes, such as Acousto-optic Tunable Filter (AOTF), Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF), Linear Variable Filter (LVF), Integrated Stepwise Filter (ISF), Tunable Fabry-Perot Filter (TFPF) and computational spectral imaging system based on compressed sensing, are available at present. These spectroscopic image methods are still in the stage of laboratory experiments. An increasing attention has also been paid to the chip-level hyperspectral spectroscopy, which combines light splitting with photoelectric conversion. (3) With the advances in the ""artificial intelligence,"" machine learning data process, such as neural network and deep learning, has become a trend with hyperspectral imaging to construct an 'intelligent' hyperspectral remote sensing satellite system. This technology will integrate the ability of automatic optimization of onboard load parameters and automatic real-time processing of onboard data and product generation. Meanwhile, the amount of remote sensing data obtained is explosively growing with the increase in resolution and information dimensions of hyperspectral imaging instruments. ""Big data"" feature is significant. Data transmission is an important issue in successfully using the effective data mining and information extraction and improving the efficiency of data compression in the future. (4) The development of small UAV and micro-nano satellite technology has developed hyperspectral imaging toward a low-cost, flexible, integrated, and real-time technology. At present, the light and small hyperspectral imaging technology based on small UAV is greatly demanded and valuable in the fields of agricultural, forestry diseases and insect pests' detection, target search, and rescue and relief. Micro-nano satellites have low cost and short development cycle and can conduct complex space remote sensing tasks. The combination of hyperspectral imaging and micro-nano satellite technologies will promote the integration of multi-functional structure and space exploration payload. Lightweight, integrated, and systematized hyperspectral remote sensing with space networking and all-time detection will play an important role in the future. It will provide the possibility for hyperspectral remote sensing satellites to enter the commercial field. Many new principles, schemes, and technologies are being implemented and applied in hyperspectral imaging. The integrated acquisition and processing ability of multiple information is also greatly enhanced. The hyperspectral load is gradually developing in the direction of large field of view, large relative aperture, high resolution, and high quantification. The cost of hyperspectral remote sensing technology will be greatly reduced with its continuous development and maturity. The commercial application of this technology will also be an important direction of future development.","['cold', 'developed', 'new', 'several', 'appearance', 'inorbit', 'view', 'liquid', 'greatly', 'diseases', 'rescue', 'acoustooptic', 'forward', 'width', 'relative', 'probachris', 'present', 'corporation', 'eg', 'monitoring', 'enter', 'multifunctional', 'possibility', 'role', 'sun', 'costal', 'isf', 'signal', 'remote', 'artificial', 'since', 'complex', 'trend', 'wide', 'pests', 'specim', 'filter', 'lowcost', 'increasingly', 'acquire', 'examples', 'beam', 'forestry', 'neural', 'provide', 'combination', 'follows', 'exploration', 'schemes', 'geometric', 'mature', 'advances', 'allday', 'spectroscopy', 'calibration', 'operation', 'refined', 'multiple', 'product', 'airborne', 'developing', 'omis', 'chinese', 'successfully', 'load', 'optics', 'outlook', 'hyperspectral', 'largescale', 'interference', 'type', 'spectral', 'satellites', 'one', 'super', 'agriculture', 'moon', 'cost', 'largeaperture', 'systematized', 'growing', 'reduced', 'band', 'ground', 'insect', 'dispersion', 'available', 'built', 'past', 'enhanced', 'relief', 'obtain', 'lwir', 'conduct', 'canada', 'operated', 'finland', 'still', 'image', 'resolution', 'experiments', 'sensitivity', 'increasing', 'commercial', 'phi', 'tunable', 'compressed', 'direction', 'resource', 'attention', 'lvf', 'ever', 'fields', 'issue', 'micronano', 'target', 'emission', 'search', 'ensure', 'spectroscopic', 'hand', 'improving', 'field', 'valuable', 'play', 'extraction', 'aviris', 'uav', 'system', 'observations', 'compression', 'paid', 'plane', 'machining', 'intelligence', 'become', 'mining', 'detectors', 'systems', 'large', 'applied', 'networking', 'lightweight', 'decades', 'high', 'structure', 'integration', 'dimensions', 'natural', 'efficiency', 'continuous', 'laboratory', 'payload', 'abundant', 'globally', 'pioneer', 'reflectance', 'deep', 'america', 'linear', 'core', 'integrate', 'optical', 'elements', 'automatic', 'amount', 'range', 'imaging', 'meanwhile', 'realtime', 'effective', 'combines', 'stage', 'realized', 'companies', 'satellite', 'significant', 'technology', 'tfpf', 'detection', 'ability', 'becoming', 'higher', 'explosively', 'flexible', 'network', 'array', 'toward', 'imagers', 'radiation', 'photoelectric', 'chiplevel', 'addition', 'conversion', 'novel', 'space', 'integrated', 'maturity', 'international', 'spectra', 'variable', 'oceans', 'sensing', 'precision', 'important', 'feature', 'disaster', 'vista', 'transmission', 'obtained', 'technologies', 'principles', 'detector', 'construct', 'survey', 'aotf', 'advanced', 'demanded', 'spectrum', 'air', 'optimization', 'increase', 'cycle', 'learning', 'era', 'light', 'instruments', 'introduced', 'tasks', 'fabryperot', 'low', 'stars', 'designed', 'marks', 'small', 'imager', 'machine', 'cover', 'diversified', 'develop', 'objects', 'lctf', 'intelligent', 'quantification', 'crystal', 'spaceborne', 'swath', 'splitting', 'applications', 'short', 'parameters', 'computational', 'characteristics', 'uv', 'implemented', 'itres', 'first', 'acquisition', 'hymap', 'puts', 'requirements', 'platforms', 'technique', 'aperture', 'earth', 'stepwise', 'future', 'gradually', 'processing', 'improved', 'agricultural', 'working', 'environment', 'promote', 'onboard', 'many', 'generation', 'alltime']",2021,"[(3, 0.9993679)]"
21st century daily seamless data cube reconstruction and seasonal to annual land cover and land use dynamics mapping-iMap (China) 1.0,Liu H.,National Remote Sensing Bulletin,10.11834/jrs.20210580,16,True,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"Sustainable development goals such as food security, high-quality habitat construction, biodiversity conservation, planetary health, and the understanding, modeling, and management of the Earth system urgently require multi-scale, long time series, high-accuracy, and consistent remote sensing observation datasets and mapping products with flexible classification systems to meet user needs. However, due to technical and cost constraints, it is difficult for conventional remote sensing satellites to provide observations with high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality at the same time. The existing mapping and inversion schemes are mostly for a single sensor, making it difficult to fully exploit and jointly utilize the information potential of multi-source heterogeneous remote sensing big data, resulting in limited observation periods and resolutions, low spatial and temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, new technical paradigms are urgently needed in the field of remote sensing. In this paper, based on advanced technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellation, spatio-temporal fusion reconstruction, an intelligent mapping framework is proposed for remote sensing big data. The framework is user-driven and problem-driven, which can significantly improve the current situation that remote sensing data products can hardly meet users' diversified and high-precision surface monitoring needs in agriculture and forestry management, national monitoring, ecological environment protection, disaster prevention and mitigation, urban planning, etc. Under this framework's guidance, we built an online real-time, automated, serverless, end-to-end remote sensing big data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) high-performance, elastic, and scalable distributed computing resources. We produced the first set of 21st century daily Seamless Data Cube (SDC) and seasonal to annual land cover and land use mapping products of China. Integrating Landsat and MODIS satellite as a virtual constellation, through multi-source spatio-temporal data fusion and reconstruction technology, the daily SDC, cloud-free, high-precision reflectance product, is developed. As Analysis Ready Data (ARD), it lays the foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing inversion and mapping. Based on SDC, we developed the seasonal to annual mapping product with multiple multi-level land cover and land use classification systems, whose mean annual accuracy exceeds 80%.

Exploring impact of surrounding service facilities on urban vibrancy using tencent location-aware data: A case of Guangzhou,Zhang X.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su13020444,15,True,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"Urban vibrancy contributes towards a successful city and high-quality life for people as one of its vital elements. Therefore, the association between service facilities and vibrancy is crucial for urban managers to understand and improve city construction. Moreover, the rapid development of information and communications technology (ICT) allows researchers to easily and quickly collect a large volume of real-time data generated by people in daily life. In this study, against the background of emerging multi-source big data, we utilized Tencent location data as a proxy for 24-h vibrancy and adopted point-of-interest (POI) data to represent service facilities. An analysis framework integrated with ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal relationships between urban vibrancy and POI-based variables. Empirical results show that (1) spatiotemporal variations exist in the impact of service facilities on urban vibrancy across Guangzhou, China; and (2) GTWR models exhibit a higher degree of explanatory capacity on vibrancy than the OLS models.

Spatial Pattern and Influencing Factors of the Consumer Service Industry in Shenzhen Based on Multisource Big Data,Wang N.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003381,6,False,Peking University,Beijing,China,"The consumer service industry directly provides residents with material and spiritual living consumption services and products to meet residents' consumption needs. The reasonable spatial layout of the consumer service industry is of great significance for improving residents' quality of living, optimizing the urban spatial structure, and alleviating urban problems. Based on consumer service point of interest (POI) data, mobile phone signaling data, and population data from Shenzhen, using the nearest neighbor index, kernel density, and entropy index methods, this study analyzes the spatial pattern of the overall and different types of consumer service industry as well as the spatial characteristics of the degree of mixing in the consumer service industry in Shenzhen. Using the Geodetector method, this study also detects the impacts of seven factors, including population, traffic, economy, and space dimensions, on the overall and different types of consumption service industry as well as analyzing the impacts of population age structure on the spatial pattern of this industry and its types. This study is expected to provide a theoretical and decision-making basis for urban planning and development in Shenzhen and other cities. The results show that: 1) The spatial distribution of the consumer service industry in Shenzhen is unbalanced and is concentrated in the central and western regions. The consumer service industry presents the spatial characteristics of two core areas and three belt areas. The two core areas are the Dongmen business area in Luohu District and the Huaqiangbei business area in Futian District. The three belt areas consist of the Luohu-Futian belt, Nanshan-Baoan belt, and Longhua belt. The spatial distribution of the consumer service industry has developed along strips and is mainly concentrated in the areas around the main roads and rail lines. 2) The spatial agglomeration characteristics of the overall and different types of consumer service industry are remarkable and differentiated in Shenzhen. The spatial distribution characteristics of most types of consumer services are similar to those of the overall consumer service industry. The development of industry in some areas has resulted in differences in the spatial distribution of certain categories. 3) The balance of the consumer service industry is better in the Luohu, Futian, Nanshan District and worse in the other Districts. The high balanced areas are the edge areas outside the two core areas, rather than the two core areas with the highest POI density. 4) Population density factors are the most important factors affecting the spatial pattern of the consumer service industry, followed by traffic factors. The influence of economic and spatial factors is relatively low. 5) The population of people aged 19-35 has the greatest impact on the density of the consumer service industry. Age groups have different impacts on the spatial distribution of different types of consumer service industries because of specific needs. These results are consistent with the spatial planning of urban functional zoning and industrial development layout in the Shenzhen Urban Master Plan (2010-2020).

Biodiversity conservation has been upgraded to a national strategy and incorporated into the top-level design, with laws and regulations gradually being improved and major scientific breakthroughs continuously being achieved. Through the implementation of major biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration projects, establishment of protected area system, and delineation of ecological red line, important ecosystems and endangered species have been effectively protected, and social participation and public awareness have been significantly improved. In addition, by signing a number of biodiversity-related international conventions and agreements and proposing the “Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition”, China has transformed from an important participant to an active contributor of international agreements. However, there are still problems to be solved and areas for further improvement in biodiversity conservation, such as pursuing quantitative targets while ignoring ecosystem structure and connectivity, insufficient conservation input on marine ecosystem, single source conservation funding mechanism, and non-uniform monitoring data which cannot be effectively integrated and analyzed. In the future, conservation strategies should focus on strengthening top-level design; promoting the synergy between conventions; integrating biodiversity conservation into the territorial and spatial planning, and pollution control; improving quality instead of pursuing quantitative targets; reinforcing marine biodiversity conservation, the construction of wild animal genetic resources bank and field stations, and the research in invasive species and wildlife infectious diseases; and building a big data platform to facilitate the sharing and data mining of biodiversity information.

It particularly aims to analyse the effects of the strong acceleration of the urban transformation of reconstructed historic cities after a disaster such as L’Aquila, an instable historic centre of Central Italy hit by an earthquake in 2009. In this historic centre, there are many innovation-oriented initiatives, that refer to the principles of the smart city, but the local context is incapable to transfer technologies and innovative solutions to create new effective services for citizens. The analysis of the case study of L’Aquila and scientific literature, which presents clear gaps on the subject, made it possible to identify two technologies macro-categories: tangible technologies and intangible technologies. In the context of these two macro-categories and in relation to the general theme of the application of these to changes in the historic centre, the research has highlighted a significant impact on urban design and on society, that it calls into question two concepts that the chapter seeks to reinterpret in a smart key: the conservation and protection of historical values, that direct or constrain the transformations of our cultural heritage (tangible), and new citizenship rights (intangible). It is a remarkable field of experimentation in which, however, scientific urban planning and design insufficiencies are compared, and where above all experimentation clashes with the acceptance of new technologies by local communities.

The historic neighbourhood of Alfama (Lisbon), a case study",Yubero C.,Investigaciones Turisticas,10.14198/INTURI2021.22.5,3,True,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,"Tourism flows to large cities have increased drastically in the past few years. The Alfama neighbourhood in Lisbon (Portugal) is facing major changes with respect to land uses, demographic features and social appropriation patterns in public spaces, caused by the intensification of tourism. The consequences of new emerging economic and symbolic values have rapidly given rise to a scenario of touristification and gentrification in the neighbourhood. In order to address such complexities, sustainable urban planning can benefit from real-time data sources that can represent the tourism flows in spatial and temporal perspectives. The research question allows Twitter to be used as an emerging data source and for analysing spatial patterns and content, based on two sample groups: residents and tourists, and their interpretations about the use of space for leisure activities.

Urban physical examination evaluation based on multisource data: A case study of changsha city,Yu X.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003325,1,False,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"With the continuous increase in the rate of urbanization, more attention is being paid to quality of life in cities. At present, China's major cities are facing multiple challenges, including resource shortages, environmental pollution, population congestion, traffic congestion, and inequality of public service facilities, all of which have become controversial issues affecting the development of high-quality human settlements. Taking Changsha City as an example, this study attempts to solve the problems of incomplete physical examination elements, slow data update, and previously inconsistent evaluation standards. Under the guidance of problems and objectives, a scientific, comprehensive, applicable, and operable urban physical examination index system was built to provide effective support for the comparative analysis and accurate evaluation of urban development positioning. Based on remote sensing images, social open big data, and statistical data, this study constructed an urban physical examination index system from eight aspects: Ecological livability, health and comfort, safety and resilience, convenient transportation, style and features, tidiness and order, multiple inclusiveness, and innovation vitality. The evaluation standard value was determined from the perspective of vertical national standards and planning references, along with a horizontal comparison of cities at the same level. The normalization method and analytic hierarchy process were used to calculate and evaluate the urban natural background and operational signs. The findings were as follows: 1) The overall human settlement of Changsha is good, and the comprehensive score of each aspect above 0.7. The city has a high degree of ecological livability and cleanliness, but the aspects of traffic convenience and safety resilience need to be improved. There is still room for improvement in style and characteristics, health and comfort, innovation and vitality, and diversity and inclusiveness. 2) The level of thematic development in each district and county is uneven. Yuelu District has the highest average score, while Kaifu District and Tianxin District have the most balanced development levels in terms of different aspects. On the basis of retaining the regional functional characteristics, each district and county should focus on solving development and narrowing the gap with other districts and counties. 3) The indicators of population density in the central urban area, number of days with good air quality, and mortality rate of 10,000 vehicles are at the highest level, but there is still a certain gap with the urban development demand in terms of complete coverage of convenience service facilities, residential building renewal and development, and group inclusion, among other aspects. According to the results of urban physical examination based on multisource data, in the future Changsha City needs to be solutionoriented, accurately manage ""urban disease, "" and strive to improve the life satisfaction, happiness, and sense of belonging of urban residents. This study could provide reference research ideas for the fusion of static statistical data and dynamic emerging data derived from urban physical examination, the construction of a scientific and comprehensive index system, and the establishment of horizontal and vertical evaluation standards. At the same time, it could provide decision support for the diagnosis of prominent urban disease problems in Changsha and the better management of the city.","['facing', 'become', 'management', 'social', 'number', 'belonging', 'method', 'balanced', 'strive', 'high', 'tianxin', 'district', 'human', 'open', 'inequality', 'eight', 'natural', 'improve', 'time', 'continuous', 'style', 'solutionoriented', 'horizontal', 'traffic', 'positioning', 'convenient', 'complete', 'cities', 'prominent', 'objectives', 'attempts', 'present', 'service', 'vitality', 'calculate', 'congestion', 'counties', 'diagnosis', 'elements', 'narrowing', 'days', 'including', 'kaifu', 'fusion', 'vertical', 'levels', 'remote', 'cleanliness', 'multisource', 'population', 'group', 'effective', 'comparison', 'manage', 'demand', 'problems', 'uneven', 'tidiness', 'aspects', 'dynamic', 'need', 'major', 'scientific', 'provide', 'ecological', 'controversial', 'follows', 'ideas', 'guidance', 'could', 'central', 'accurate', 'county', 'basis', 'room', 'comparative', 'reference', 'degree', 'affecting', 'residential', 'vehicles', 'terms', 'multiple', 'challenges', 'average', 'index', 'better', 'previously', 'thematic', 'standards', 'sensing', 'rate', 'retaining', 'along', 'value', 'resilience', 'perspective', 'operational', 'chinas', 'accurately', 'analytic', 'public', 'determined', 'mortality', 'highquality', 'convenience', 'livability', 'diversity', 'indicators', 'national', 'improvement', 'inclusion', 'order', 'constructed', 'gap', 'coverage', 'transportation', 'health', 'urbanization', 'air', 'built', 'increase', 'incomplete', 'shortages', 'renewal', 'signs', 'emerging', 'still', 'overall', 'good', 'needs', 'according', 'settlements', 'yuelu', 'happiness', 'certain', 'examination', 'changsha', 'background', 'score', 'highest', 'city', 'normalization', 'resource', 'standard', 'settlement', 'establishment', 'inclusiveness', 'attention', 'slow', 'comprehensive', 'applicable', 'area', 'taking', 'example', 'construction', 'environmental', 'density', 'hierarchy', 'issues', 'physical', 'inconsistent', 'features', 'characteristics', 'functional', 'static', 'innovation', 'solving', 'satisfaction', 'building', 'life', 'focus', 'residents', 'quality', 'update', 'evaluate', 'references', 'facilities', 'different', 'solve', 'aspect', 'sense', 'support', 'pollution', 'operable', 'future', 'system', 'improved', 'districts', 'among', 'statistical', 'disease', 'paid', 'comfort', 'images', 'level', 'safety', 'regional', 'derived', 'decision']",2021,"[(1, 0.55869204), (2, 0.4408586)]"

Review on Data Sharing in Smart City Planning Based on Mobile Phone Signaling Big Data: From the Perspective of China Experience: Anonymization VS De-anonymization,Lin Y.,International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development,10.14246/IRSPSD.9.2_76,11,True,Kanazawa University,Kanazawa,Japan,"In the smart city planning based on spatiotemporal big data, the mobile phone signaling big data is the most commonly used data source at the moment. This kind of big data has time and space dimensions and also significant human behavior attributes. According to the relevant Chinese law, the data has been anonymized before sharing, i.e. cannot be identified as a specific individual and cannot be restored again, thus is no longer regarded as personal information. In smart city planning, the mobile phone signaling big data is used to construct the basic dynamic analysis framework of ""space-time-behavior"". Even if the mobile phone signaling big data has been processed anonymously, it will inevitably show some specific location attribute information of mobile phone users. The anonymous track information can be matched to the corresponding geographical space, so as to mark the active location information of the information subject in a specific period of time. It can easily identify the specific location information such as the job and residence of mobile phone user, and even give user portrait. Existing technology shows that the mobile phone signaling big data is easy to be de-anonymized, and Anonymity rule are not applicable to the sharing of mobile phone signaling big data in the smart city planning. Mobile phone signaling big data belongs to personal sensitive information. Once leaked or abused, it is easy to infringe personal privacy of information subject. Therefore, only using current anonymization means to share the mobile phone signaling big data are not enough to protect the security of personal information in smart city planning, and sharing the mobile phone signaling big data should follow the basic principle of explicit informed consent. In special circumstances or scenarios, breaking through the basic principle of the mobile phone signaling big data sharing should have clear legal provisions and comply with legal procedures.","['easy', 'provisions', 'can', 'not', 'existing', 'abused', 'privacy', 'protect', 'matched', 'ie', 'human', 'dimensions', 'users', 'time', 'inevitably', 'geographical', 'therefore', 'circumstances', 'relevant', 'smart', 'easily', 'corresponding', 'special', 'security', 'active', 'breaking', 'anonymization', 'consent', 'spacetimebehavior', 'scenarios', 'even', 'sharing', 'location', 'track', 'informed', 'anonymized', 'restored', 'significant', 'anonymous', 'give', 'technology', 'leaked', 'dynamic', 'infringe', 'principle', 'rule', 'moment', 'follow', 'shows', 'longer', 'space', 'clear', 'law', 'processed', 'enough', 'means', 'chinese', 'user', 'show', 'behavior', 'explicit', 'job', 'construct', 'commonly', 'specific', 'residence', 'attributes', 'regarded', 'anonymously', 'according', 'identified', 'individual', 'personal', 'city', 'kind', 'mobile', 'portrait', 'phone', 'applicable', 'source', 'deanonymized', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'basic', 'share', 'signaling', 'spatiotemporal', 'mark', 'identify', 'legal', 'period', 'belongs', 'current', 'comply', 'anonymity', 'thus', 'procedures', 'attribute']",2021,"[(1, 0.3584508), (2, 0.64063305)]"

This rate will further increase to more than 70% in 2030, with most of the population lives in cities. Cities are the engine of economic development in China. With 7% of the terrestrial area, they produced 70% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), and the urban agglomerations even concentrated more population and GDP in China. The health and sustainability of cities and urban agglomerations therefore will determine China's development quality and progress in the future.

Data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: An evidence synthesis approach to a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review,Bibri S.E.,Sustainable Futures,10.1016/j.sftr.2021.100047,106,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Sustainable cities are currently undergoing unprecedented transformative changes in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.","['become', 'technocratic', 'management', 'new', 'social', 'systems', 'several', 'existing', 'uptake', 'enabled', 'deal', 'entails', 'fragmentary', 'integration', 'questions', 'well', 'attempt', 'improve', 'sustainabilityunder', 'literature', 'policymakers', 'assess', 'inform', 'goals', 'datadriven', 'together', 'problematicity', 'shedding', 'seeks', 'smart', 'prospective', 'marked', 'cities', 'technocentric', 'raises', 'forms', 'contribution', 'currently', 'monitoring', 'managing', 'recent', 'outcomes', 'undergoing', 'takes', 'urbanism', 'termed', 'adoption', 'including', 'innovative', 'practitioners', 'embody', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'way', 'complexities', 'say', 'significant', 'increasingly', 'sustainability', 'aspects', 'motivated', 'technology', 'irreversible', 'whether', 'fundamental', 'shift', 'need', 'effectively', 'tackle', 'addressed', 'respectively', 'infancythat', 'embracing', 'inherently', 'critique', 'leveraging', 'directions', 'reference', 'achieving', 'equal', 'scholars', 'addition', 'novel', 'compelling', 'prevailing', 'terms', 'provides', 'developments', 'stimulate', 'stateoftheart', 'quintessential', 'paradigms', 'evolving', 'analytics', 'desired', 'operational', 'surrounding', 'approaches', 'important', 'corroborates', 'debates', 'ways', 'importance', 'solutions', 'technologies', 'reveals', 'strategies', 'face', 'gap', 'extent', 'necessary', 'urbanization', 'burgeoning', 'planners', 'increase', 'paradigm', 'flourishing', 'itselfas', 'offer', 'concerns', 'light', 'effectuating', 'era', 'emerging', 'still', 'bringing', 'science', 'increased', 'increasing', 'transformative', 'crucial', 'changes', 'respect', 'work', 'policy', 'governance', 'comprehensive', 'monitor', 'transformations', 'applications', 'review', 'help', 'area', 'contemporary', 'pros', 'functions', 'material', 'environmental', 'latest', 'critical', 'analyzing', 'addressing', 'field', 'valuable', 'evaluate', 'mechanisms', 'synthesis', 'cons', 'change', 'future', 'topic', 'fill', 'regard', 'brought', 'maintain', 'unprecedented']",2021,"[(3, 0.9989429)]"
Data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: New conceptions of and approaches to the spatial scaling of urban form,Bibri S.E.,Future Cities and Environment,10.5334/fce.120,9,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"There is a growing interest in urban form as the spatial concretization of urban sustainability. At the core of sustainable urban form is the spatial pattern of the different types of the physical objects character-izing the built-up areas of settlements at different spatial scales. The spatial features of urban design is key to producing the benefits of sustainability and enacting its effects as outcomes of processes. However, it has been difficult to evaluate how and to what extent sustainable urban forms contribute to sustainability and to judge whether or not a certain sustainable urban form is actually sustainable. Therefore, there is a need to find more effective ways to address and implement the spatial scaling of sustainable urban form in an attempt to increase the positive outcomes of sustainability. This relates to the emerging model of sustainable cities, which is increasingly being enabled by urban computing and intelligence in terms of planning and design under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities”. This paper analyzes and discusses the emerging conceptions of and approaches to spatial scales that should be considered in the planning and design of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. In doing so, it highlights the innovative potential of urban computing and intelligence for enhancing and transforming the spatial scaling of sustainable urban form. I argue that data-driven technologies allow sustainable urban forms to monitor, understand, and analyze the different aspects of their spatial scaling for generating the kind of designs that improve sustainability. Conceiving spatial scales as outcomes of processes and planning accordingly hold great potential for attaining the goals of sustainability. Sus-tainability outcomes are multi-scalar in nature, which justifies the need to integrate spatial scales that have clear synergies in their management and planning and need to be coupled. This synergic integration produces combined effects that are greater than the sum of the separate effects of spatial scales with respect to sustainability benefits.","['intelligence', 'management', 'coupled', 'transforming', 'enabled', 'nature', 'analyze', 'allow', 'integration', 'attempt', 'improve', 'therefore', 'goals', 'datadriven', 'hold', 'synergic', 'smart', 'enacting', 'justifies', 'considered', 'cities', 'form', 'forms', 'contribute', 'sum', 'core', 'integrate', 'outcomes', 'positive', 'termed', 'judge', 'produces', 'innovative', 'producing', 'sustainable', 'concretization', 'effective', 'sustainability', 'implement', 'increasingly', 'discusses', 'whether', 'aspects', 'need', 'processes', 'understand', 'multiscalar', 'highlights', 'find', 'synergies', 'areas', 'clear', 'terms', 'benefits', 'types', 'conceptions', 'computing', 'enhancing', 'approaches', 'great', 'ways', 'technologies', 'growing', 'generating', 'extent', 'key', 'difficult', 'designs', 'increase', 'conceiving', 'scales', 'relates', 'builtup', 'emerging', 'settlements', 'characterizing', 'effects', 'objects', 'certain', 'respect', 'monitor', 'kind', 'interest', 'potential', 'address', 'argue', 'combined', 'actually', 'physical', 'features', 'pattern', 'evaluate', 'different', 'accordingly', 'scaling', 'future', 'attaining', 'analyzes', 'greater', 'separate']",2021,"[(3, 0.9982466)]"

A novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: A strategic roadmap to transformational change in the era of big data,Bibri S.E.,Future Cities and Environment,10.5334/FCE.116,39,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"The conscious push for sustainable cities to be smarter and thus more sustainable in the era of big data is due to the problematicity surrounding their development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms, as well as the fragmentation of their designs and technologies. This has a clear bearing on their performance with respect to the contribution to and balancing of the goals of sustainability. This situation is compounded by the negative consequences of the expansion of urbanization, an irreversible global trend involving a multitude of environmental, social, economic, and spatial conditions that pose unprecedented challenges to policymakers and planners. The underlying argument is that more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods are needed to enable sustainable cities to tackle the kind of problems and complexities they embody. This in turn brings us to the question related to the weak connection between sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches as well as their extreme fragmentation as landscapes, both at the technical and policy levels. Therefore, sustainable cities need to embrace and leverage what smart cities have to offer so that they can optimize, enhance, and maintain their performance and thus achieve the desired outcomes of sustainability. This paper aims to develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future, and in doing so, it provides a strategic planning process of transformative change towards sustainability. This model combines and integrates the prevailing paradigms of sustainable urbanism and the emerging paradigms of smart urbanism —based on the outcomes of the four case studies conducted on compact cities, eco-cities, data–driven smart cities, and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities. As the core of this aggregate model is how to bring about the different forms of infrastructural transformations needed to reach a vision of a sustainable future in the era of big data. Especially, it has become feasible to attain important improvements and advancements of sustainability by amalgamating sustainable cities and smart cities thanks to the proven role of advanced ICT and the untapped potential of data-driven technologies.","['become', 'untapped', 'management', 'social', 'case', 'aims', 'conscious', 'well', 'bearing', 'proven', 'therefore', 'global', 'policymakers', 'goals', 'datadriven', 'problematicity', 'argument', 'conditions', 'smart', 'cities', 'strategic', 'contribution', 'forms', 'needed', 'core', 'weak', 'outcomes', 'compact', 'pose', 'amalgamating', 'sophisticated', 'urbanism', 'role', 'innovative', 'integrates', 'embody', 'levels', 'sustainable', 'compounded', 'trend', 'complexities', 'problems', 'combines', 'improvements', 'sustainability', 'irreversible', 'four', 'enhance', 'advancements', 'need', 'towards', 'ecocities', 'question', 'due', 'tackle', 'economic', 'landscapes', 'balancing', 'consequences', 'novel', 'environmentally', 'clear', 'underlying', 'thanks', 'prevailing', 'provides', 'challenges', 'enable', 'paradigms', 'expansion', 'multitude', 'desired', 'operational', 'surrounding', 'approaches', 'negative', 'connection', 'leverage', 'important', 'extreme', 'solutions', 'related', 'technologies', 'bring', 'studies', 'involving', 'advanced', 'us', 'designs', 'urbanization', 'planners', 'attain', 'feasible', 'reach', 'push', 'offer', 'era', 'achieve', 'emerging', 'transformative', 'turn', 'aggregate', 'develop', 'respect', 'policy', 'conducted', 'technical', 'vision', 'kind', 'transformations', 'potential', 'situation', 'smarter', 'ict', 'environmental', 'optimize', 'mechanisms', 'different', 'infrastructural', 'future', 'thus', 'change', 'fragmentation', 'brings', 'especially', 'maintain', 'unprecedented', 'embrace']",2021,"[(2, 0.2878264), (3, 0.71118325)]"
Digital Business Development in the Urban Environment of the Future: Economic and Social Effects,Grishin V.N.,"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",10.1007/978-3-030-56433-9_86,0,False,The State University of Management,Moscow,Russian Federation,"Due to the rapid growth of the urban population all over the world and the emergence of methods for analyzing big data, there is growing interest in works devoted to the study of current trends in changing urban structure. Studies have shown that the «smart city» system primarily focuses on the integration of three components: economic, social and environmental. Smart cities add digital intelligence to existing urban systems, allowing you to solve more problems at lower cost. When cities function more efficiently, they become more productive places to do business. In addition, digital technology helps increase social cohesion. The social component includes, first of all, democracy with the participation of citizens. In many cases, smart cities focus on finding answers to various urban problems by introducing information and communication technologies (ICT), which are designed to collect citizen feedback or provide resources for information that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are still few scientific and practical works in which an attempt is made to assess the possibilities of solving urban problems based on digital technologies: from citizens living to doing business in a single unified environment. The purpose of this study is to attempt to develop such a unified approach. The novelty of the study is the refinement of the concept of «smart city», the analysis of the use of its dynamic capabilities with a focus on the stages «assessing the importance of an event» and «using opportunities», where ICT technologies are used as a tool for collecting information from citizens.

Several urban growth areas developed during the recent housing bubble in the Metropolitan Area of Madrid (1990-2012), are used as case study. Due to the recent and rapid urbanization, and potential mechanisms of simplification of the urban fabric, these areas are believed to lack an identity.

Using big data analytics to synthesize research domains and identify emerging fields in urban climatology,Huo F.,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change,10.1002/wcc.688,14,False,Global Institute for Water Security,Saskatoon,Canada,"The growing concerns over urbanization and climate change have resulted in an exponential growth in publications on urban climatology in recent decades. However, an advanced synthesis that characterizes the existing studies is lacking. In this review, we used citation network analysis and a text mining approach to identify research trends and extract common research topics and the emerging domains in urban climatology. Based on the clustered networks, we found that aerosols and ozone, and urban heat island are the most popular topics. Together with other clusters, four emerging topical fields were identified: secondary organic aerosols, urban precipitation, flood risk and adaptation, and greenhouse gas emissions. The city case studies' geographical information was analyzed to explore the spatial–temporal patterns, especially in the emerging topical fields. Interdisciplinary research grew in recent years as the field of urban climatology expanded to interact with urban hydrology, health, energy issues, and social sciences. A few knowledge gaps were proposed: the lack of long-term high-temporal-resolution observational data of organic aerosols for model validation and improvements, the need for predictions of urban effects on precipitation and extreme flooding events under climate change, and the lack of a framework for cooperation between physical sciences and social sciences under urban settings. To fill these gaps, we call for more observational data with high spatial and temporal resolution, using high-resolution models that adequately represent urban processes to conduct scenario analyses for urban planning, and the development of intellectual frameworks for better integration of urban climatology and social-economical systems in cities.

Until 2014, only 20% of the total population lived in urban areas, but in 2015, over 65% of people were classified as urban dwellers with the promulgation of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nepal (FRN). Many rural areas are annexed together to meet the population thresholds of some territories in order to classify them as municipals. As of 2017, many of the existing local level political units (which were over 3700) have been combined together reducing the local political units to 753 in total. Until 2014, there were only 105 urban units, but when local political units were decreased to 753 as per the FRN, the number of urban units jumped from 105 to 293 with 276 municipalities, 11 sub-metropolises, and 6 metropolises. However, many of these so classified urban areas are characterized by ruralopolises where people living in rural settings within the legally defined urban areas are competing for the limited facilities of the urban cores. Despite such competition for limited resources/facilities, many of the ruralopolises are aspiring to becoming “smart cities.” However, political leaders and urban planners responsible for the planning of these ruralopolises have been struggling to have real-time geospatial data, one of the essential components of “smart cities.” A “smart city” is an integrated system in which human and social capitals interact, using technology-based solutions. It efficiently achieves sustainable and resilient development and helps maintain a high urban life quality based on a multi-stakeholders’ partnership. The “smart city” initiatives need real-time data that uses auto-sensor state-of-the-art technology. The economic outcomes of a “smart city” initiative results in the simplification of daily working schedules such as bus routing, waste disposal, creation of businesses, jobs, and infrastructure. The brain of a “smart city” includes the virtual real-time data center-fed by an automated sensor network that regulates kiosks, parking meters, cameras, smart phones, medical devices, social networks, and bus routings. Gathering of real-time big data with high accuracy becomes a huge challenge. However, it will be sustainable and cost-effective to engage various stakeholders to gather quality data and develop models to examine the utilities of such data.

Although offering more generalized use and extended range, DBSS exhibits great variability in local use rate, suggesting that control of certain local environmental attributes could be instrumental in supporting more widespread bicycle use. This article is concerned with the relationship between street morphology defined at the street segment level and related shared bicycle use rate. Mobike trip data for a 10-day period in May, 2017–3.09-m trip records with origins and destinations–were accessed. Multilevel regression analysis shows that generated trips and travel distance are positively related to both betweenness and maximum convex hull radius but are negatively related to diversion ratio. All street morphological metrics show significant effects across spatial scales.

Exploring the usage of online food delivery data for intra-urban job and housing mobility detection and characterization,Zhang Y.,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Social Computing and Networking and 2020 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Computing and Communications, ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom 2020",10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00130,0,False,University of Colorado Boulder,Boulder,United States,"Human mobility plays a critical role in urban planning and policy-making. However, at certain spatial and temporal resolutions, it is very challenging to track, for example, job and housing mobility. In this study, we explore the usage of a new modality of dataset, online food delivery data, to detect job and housing mobility. By leveraging millions of meal orders from a popular online food ordering and delivery service in Beijing, China, we are able to detect job and housing moves at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than using traditional data sources. Popular moving seasons and origins/destinations can be well identified. More importantly, we match the detected moves to both macro- and micro-level factors so as to characterize job and housing dynamics. Our findings suggest that commuting distance is a major factor for job and housing mobility. We also observe that: (1) For home movers, there is a trade-off between lower housing cost and shorter commuting distance given the urban spatial structure; (2) For job hoppers, those who frequently work overtime are more likely to reduce their working hours by switching jobs. While this new modality of dataset has its limitations, we believe that ensemble approaches would be promising, where a mash-up of multiple datasets with different characteristic limitations can provide a more comprehensive picture of job and housing dynamics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing food delivery data to detect and analyze job and housing mobility, and contributes to realizing the full potential of ensemble-based approaches.","['moves', 'new', 'microlevel', 'movers', 'seasons', 'analyze', 'human', 'structure', 'well', 'hours', 'would', 'reduce', 'tradeoff', 'characteristic', 'datasets', 'likely', 'service', 'traditional', 'demonstrates', 'suggest', 'role', 'temporal', 'match', 'millions', 'effectiveness', 'importantly', 'track', 'beijing', 'originsdestinations', 'popular', 'dataset', 'major', 'overtime', 'provide', 'limitations', 'mashup', 'policymaking', 'higher', 'leveraging', 'usage', 'full', 'moving', 'contributes', 'factor', 'hoppers', 'housing', 'multiple', 'detected', 'shorter', 'promising', 'switching', 'food', 'frequently', 'approaches', 'modality', 'job', 'commuting', 'jobs', 'cost', 'meal', 'factors', 'believe', 'lower', 'online', 'plays', 'ensemblebased', 'resolutions', 'identified', 'certain', 'dynamics', 'work', 'challenging', 'ensemble', 'given', 'comprehensive', 'picture', 'potential', 'mobility', 'example', 'explore', 'macro', 'home', 'critical', 'orders', 'utilizing', 'realizing', 'different', 'delivery', 'able', 'much', 'sources', 'distance', 'characterize', 'observe', 'working', 'ordering', 'detect']",2020,"[(1, 0.9985724)]"

The activity similarity is measured considering three dimensions of activity (location, time, and type). The trip similarity is measured considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. Third, a similarity score is defined as the multiplication of the activity and trip similarity values. To discover mutual relations between the passengers, the cosine similarity index is used.

Spatial distribution patterns and factors influencing the Shanghai catering industry based on POI data,Jinyue T.,Tropical Geography,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003280,12,False,East China Normal University,Shanghai,China,"Commercial space structure is an important research focus of Urban Geography. Analyzing the spatial distribution of urban commerce is of great significance to urban planning management, within which spatial distribution patterns of the catering industry have always been a focus of research. Quantitative analysis of the catering industry's spatial pattern and influencing factors using big data is a primary trend in recent research. This paper uses Shanghai as a case-study. Based on POI data and using GIS spatial analysis methods and spatial regression models, the spatial distribution patterns, influencing factors, and internal heterogeneity of different catering industry types are investigated. This paper's conclusions are useful for understanding the influence of urban internal spatial elements on the catering industry's spatial pattern. It also provides a location selection reference for the catering industry and analyzes residents' consumption behavior. We find that the catering industry is clustered and multi-centered, and concentrated in the central urban area. The foreign catering industry is highly concentrated within the inner ring, extending from east to west. The fast-food industry is primarily agglomerated in central areas and rural-urban continua where universities cluster. We use a spatial error model to analyze the influencing factors, finding that the catering industry distribution is influenced by four factors: population, economy, transportation, and space. A larger population provides for more consumers in the catering industry, and the spatial concentration of the population can promote the creation of more catering companies. The catering industry tends to assemble in areas with a higher level of regional economic development. Superior transportation conditions can attract catering companies, but the influences of transport facilities differ. Parking facilities and bus stations are vital to the catering industry. In terms of macroeconomic location, catering industries concentrate around regional centers. Densities of catering companies within the inner ring are significantly higher than those outside. The density of catering companies does not show a significant difference between new towns and the Puxi area. Regarding the micro-built environment, the clustering of public, leisure, entertainment, and cultural facilities positively impacts the distribution of catering companies; however, the degree of diversity of surrounding industry types negatively impacts agglomeration. There are also differences in the factors affecting the catering industry's four distribution types: Chinese food, western food, fast food, and dining establishments. Western food companies tend to be located in areas with higher land prices. Chinese food companies have a greater demand for traffic accessibility. The distribution of dining establishments corresponds significantly to the level of local economic development. The distribution of fast-food companies is closely related to cultural and entertainment public facilities.

Spatiotemporal exploration of chinese spring festival population flow patterns and their determinants based on spatial interaction model,Zhou T.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi9110670,15,True,Southwest Jiaotong University,Chengdu,China,"Large-scale population flow reshapes the economic landscape and is affected by unbalanced urban development. The exploration of migration patterns and their determinants is therefore crucial to reveal unbalanced urban development. However, low-resolution migration datasets and insufficient consideration of interactive differences have limited such exploration. Accordingly, based on 2019 Chinese Spring Festival travel-related big data from the AMAP platform, we used social network analysis (SNA) methods to accurately reveal population flow patterns. Then, with consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of interactive patterns, we used spatially weighted interactive models (SWIMs), which were improved by the incorporation of weightings into the global Poisson gravity model, to efficiently quantify the effect of socioeconomic factors on migration patterns. These SWIMs generated the local characteristics of the interactions and quantified results that were more regionally consistent than those generated by other spatial interaction models. The migration patterns had a spatially vertical structure, with the city development level being highly consistent with the flow intensity; for example, the first-level developments of Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing occupied a core position. A spatially horizontal structure was also formed, comprising 16 closely related city communities. Moreover, the quantified impact results indicated that migration pattern variation was significantly related to the population, value-added primary and secondary industry, the average wage, foreign capital, pension insurance, and certain aspects of unbalanced urban development. These findings can help policymakers to guide population migration, rationally allocate industrial infrastructure, and balance urban development.","['models', 'firstlevel', 'patterns', 'social', 'sna', 'structure', 'therefore', 'global', 'policymakers', 'limited', 'horizontal', 'closely', 'datasets', 'swims', 'core', 'spatially', 'valueadded', 'vertical', 'interactions', 'communities', 'population', 'beijing', 'highly', 'affected', 'aspects', 'festival', 'interactive', 'economic', 'exploration', 'incorporation', 'determinants', 'network', 'poisson', 'chongqing', 'reshapes', 'amap', 'foreign', 'guide', 'indicated', 'capital', 'developments', 'heterogeneity', 'average', 'chinese', 'weightings', 'interaction', 'insufficient', 'allocate', 'largescale', 'accurately', 'generated', 'occupied', 'comprising', 'chengdu', 'related', 'spring', 'quantify', 'factors', 'local', 'balance', 'socioeconomic', 'secondary', 'pension', 'intensity', 'significantly', 'rationally', 'insurance', 'weighted', 'shenzhen', 'primary', 'regionally', 'landscape', 'variation', 'industry', 'crucial', 'certain', 'infrastructure', 'city', 'platform', 'efficiently', 'formed', 'gravity', 'help', 'example', 'travelrelated', 'flow', 'industrial', 'characteristics', 'lowresolution', 'consistent', 'pattern', 'effect', 'unbalanced', 'guangzhou', 'accordingly', 'quantified', 'shanghai', 'consideration', 'improved', 'moreover', 'reveal', 'differences', 'level', 'migration', 'position', 'wage']",2020,"[(0, 0.39116815), (1, 0.60786545)]"

Evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy using spatial big data: Shanghai as a case study,Huang B.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/2399808319828730,113,False,Chinese University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"Although people may recognize urban vibrancy when they see or sense it, developing direct and comprehensive measures of urban vibrancy remains a challenge. In the context of intense global competition, there is an increased realization that urban vibrancy is vital to the social and economic sustainability of cities. Such vibrancy may be significantly shaped by the urban built environment, yet we know little about the close connections between vibrancy and urban built environments. Empowered by newly available sources of spatial big data, which provide enormous amounts of information on both human dynamics and the built environment, this paper proposes a framework for evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy. Thus far, vibrancy measures have mostly used single-source data that hardly reflect the multifaceted manifestations of urban vibrancy. Therefore, we propose a more comprehensive measure of urban vibrancy, extracted as the common latent factor from multiple surface attributes. Using the proposed framework, we evaluated and mapped the spatial dynamics of vibrancy in Shanghai, a typical large city in post-reform China, and investigated the associations between vibrancy and various urban built environment indicators. The evidence shows that the horizontal built-up density, rather than vertical height, is the leading generator of vibrancy in Shanghai, followed by the density and mixture of urban functions, accessibility, and walkability. In this vein, we contribute to current debates and future planning practices regarding vibrant spaces in large cities. This proposed evaluation framework, equipped with spatial big data, can benefit future urban studies.","['social', 'large', 'common', 'human', 'various', 'therefore', 'surface', 'evaluating', 'global', 'horizontal', 'shaped', 'realization', 'measures', 'investigated', 'vein', 'regarding', 'enormous', 'cities', 'recognize', 'proposed', 'contribute', 'amounts', 'mapped', 'intense', 'height', 'direct', 'vertical', 'newly', 'sustainability', 'leading', 'equipped', 'singlesource', 'walkability', 'provide', 'challenge', 'economic', 'reflect', 'may', 'accessibility', 'measure', 'shows', 'factor', 'manifestations', 'rather', 'propose', 'multiple', 'developing', 'vital', 'mixture', 'typical', 'know', 'remains', 'debates', 'associations', 'empowered', 'little', 'indicators', 'studies', 'see', 'attributes', 'available', 'benefit', 'built', 'connections', 'significantly', 'proposes', 'builtup', 'people', 'spaces', 'increased', 'practices', 'followed', 'close', 'characterizing', 'context', 'dynamics', 'city', 'competition', 'comprehensive', 'hardly', 'latent', 'extracted', 'functions', 'environments', 'density', 'multifaceted', 'generator', 'yet', 'postreform', 'far', 'mostly', 'sense', 'vibrant', 'current', 'although', 'shanghai', 'future', 'thus', 'sources', 'evaluated', 'environment', 'vibrancy']",2020,"[(1, 0.99864274)]"
Urban modeling for streets using vector cellular automata: Framework and its application in Beijing,Jia Z.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/2399808320942777,7,False,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"Zones, cells, and parcels have long been regarded as the main units of analysis in urban modeling. However, only limited attention has been paid to street-level urban modeling. The emergence of fine-scale open and new data available from various sources has created substantial opportunities for research on urban modeling at the street level, particularly for modeling the spatiotemporal process of urban phenomena. In this paper, the street is adopted as the spatial unit of an urban model, and a conceptual framework for such modeling based on cellular automata is proposed. The validity of the proposed framework is verified by an empirical application to the urban space within the Fifth Ring Road in Beijing from 2014 to 2018. The results show that the density of points of interest simulated by the cellular automata model for 2018 is basically consistent with the actual distribution according to direct observation, and there is no significant difference in the proportion of high, medium, and low points of interest density streets between different ring roads. In addition, the deviation rate and Kappa index are 0.1171 and 0.97, respectively, indicating the proposed model can replicate historical patterns well and predict the transition of points of interest density at the street level. Subsequently, we considered three scenarios, adopting 2018 as the base year and using the proposed model to simulate the distribution of points of interest density in 2022 and the changes in points of interest density from 2018 to 2022. The conceptual framework and empirical application also provide support for urban planning and design based on the integration of linear public space and big data.","['patterns', 'adopted', 'points', 'new', 'high', 'open', 'phenomena', 'well', 'integration', 'various', 'transition', 'ring', 'limited', 'basically', 'unit', 'considered', 'proposed', 'linear', 'simulate', 'predict', 'subsequently', 'replicate', 'scenarios', 'direct', 'modeling', 'observation', 'three', 'beijing', 'significant', 'kappa', 'street', 'provide', 'finescale', 'respectively', 'road', 'actual', 'addition', 'empirical', 'cells', 'space', 'long', 'created', 'emergence', 'index', 'rate', 'fifth', 'show', 'base', 'adopting', 'verified', 'public', 'deviation', 'available', 'simulated', 'regarded', 'main', 'within', 'year', 'particularly', 'substantial', 'low', 'according', 'streets', 'changes', 'distribution', 'streetlevel', 'zones', 'attention', 'parcels', 'difference', 'interest', 'indicating', 'density', 'roads', 'cellular', 'automata', 'consistent', 'conceptual', 'spatiotemporal', 'historical', 'validity', 'different', 'support', 'proportion', 'medium', 'sources', 'paid', 'level', 'units', 'opportunities']",2020,"[(1, 0.9984625)]"
A novel community-based trust aware recommender systems for big data cloud service networks,Deebak B.D.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102274,40,False,Vellore Institute of Technology,Vellore,India,"Internet of Things (IoT) has enhanced the appearance of the information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure of smart sustainable cities that emerge as a growth of the urban development. The potential growth of environment sustainabilities is coming into the existence of the insightful visions of ICT that include big data analytics as a computing prototype. It may draw a penetrative path to mitigate the environmental effects that utilize the natural resource to manage the intelligent infrastructure and services. Moreover, the sustainable development process plays a crucial role to catalyze IoT and big-data application that connects the economic growth with the quality of smart cities. The IoT-enabled big-data applications choose a suitable thematic analysis to direct the use of recommendation systems. It supports users in the irresistible task of examination through large quantities of data in order to select appropriate information or items. Traditional recommender systems rely on similar neighbors irrespective of their preferences/choices when computing the prediction and assuming the users to be autonomous and indistinguishable to disregard the social events between the social users which are highly not reliable. Based on this intuition in this framework, the architecture of community-based trust aware recommender systems (CB-TARS) is proposed. Users’ preferences are expressed by incorporating trusted neighbors within the community of the target user are merged in order to find similar preferences. In addition, the worth of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings inside the community and the percentage of clashes between negative and positive views. Further, rating confidence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for an unrated item is computed by aggregating the ratings of similar users within the community.

Using geographic big data that cover the entire country, this paper analyzes the urban development level (UDL) of newly added outlying patches within 275 cities at the prefecture level or above in China from 2005 to 2015. The results revealed the following. 1) High-value cities are primarily located in the east, whereas low-value cities are primarily located in the west. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA) is a major area with low UDLs, whereas the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) are major areas with high UDLs. 2) The results of a multivariate regression demonstrate that GDP per capita (GDPPC), average elevation (AE), the distance between the new outlying urban patches, the proportion of secondary industry in GDP (PSI), the average land price in the city (ALP), the original urban land areas (DIS), and economic balance (GDPSD) significantly affect the UDL values of these cities. Relatively higher GDPPC and ALP are associated with a significant increase in the UDL, while more AE, DIS, GDPSD and PSI will decrease the UDL.

An empirical analysis of the determinants of PSS usefulness in practice,Jiang H.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101505,8,True,Universiteit Utrecht,Utrecht,Netherlands,"Planning support systems (PSS) enabled by smart city technologies (big data and information and communication technologies (ICTs)) are becoming more widespread in their availability, but have not yet been fully recognized as being useful in planning practice. Thus, a better understanding of the determinants of PSS usefulness in practice helps to improve the functional support of PSS for smart cities. This study is based on a recent international questionnaire (268 respondents) designed to evaluate the perceptions of scholars and practitioners in the smart city planning field. Based on the empirical evidence, this paper recommends that it is imperative for PSS developers and users to be more responsive to the fit for task-technology and user-technology (i.e., utility and usability, respectively) since they positively contribute to PSS usefulness in practice and to be more sensitive to the potential negative effects of contextual factors on PSS usefulness in smart cities. The empirical analyses further suggest that rather than merely striving for integrating smart city technologies into advancing PSS, the way that innovative PSS are integrated into the planning framework (i.e., how well PSS can satisfy the needs of planning tasks and users by considering context-specificities) is of great significance in promoting PSS's actual usefulness.","['systems', 'enabled', 'ie', 'positively', 'advancing', 'well', 'promoting', 'improve', 'users', 'considering', 'usertechnology', 'widespread', 'recommends', 'analyses', 'perceptions', 'smart', 'cities', 'contribute', 'recent', 'suggest', 'psss', 'innovative', 'practitioners', 'fit', 'since', 'questionnaire', 'helps', 'way', 'tasktechnology', 'responsive', 'becoming', 'respectively', 'determinants', 'actual', 'usefulness', 'scholars', 'empirical', 'integrated', 'rather', 'international', 'usability', 'pss', 'availability', 'better', 'merely', 'contextual', 'utility', 'negative', 'great', 'icts', 'technologies', 'contextspecificities', 'factors', 'communication', 'fully', 'useful', 'striving', 'tasks', 'practice', 'needs', 'designed', 'effects', 'respondents', 'city', 'potential', 'sensitive', 'functional', 'yet', 'developers', 'field', 'evaluate', 'imperative', 'recognized', 'support', 'integrating', 'significance', 'thus', 'satisfy']",2020,"[(1, 0.5150033), (3, 0.48391077)]"
Compact urbanism and the synergic potential of its integration with data-driven smart urbanism : An extensive interdisciplinary literature review,Bibri S.E.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104703,78,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Sustainable cities have, since the early 1990s, been the leading global paradigm of urbanism thanks to the different models of sustainable urban form proposed as new frameworks for the redesigning and restructuring of urban places to make urban living more sustainable. The compact city is the most preferred model of sustainable urbanism for responding to the challenges of sustainable development. However, despite the benefits claimed by the advocates of this model, its critics highlight a number of conflicts and contentions. This is coupled with several problems, issues, and challenges considering the very fragmented picture that arises of change on the ground in the face of urbanization. In this context, it has been suggested that the compact city needs to embrace and leverage what advanced ICT has to offer so as to improve, advance, and maintain its contribution to sustainability. With the above in regard, this paper provides a comprehensive state–of–the–art review of compact urbanism as a set of planning and development practices and strategies, focusing on the three dimensions of sustainability and the significant, yet untapped, potential of big data technology for enhancing such practices and strategies under what is labelled ‘data–driven smart sustainable urbanism.’ This paper identifies compactness, density, diversity, mixed land use, sustainable transportation, and green space as the prevalent design strategies of the compact city. At the heart of this model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects as regards the tripartite value of sustainability. Indeed, this paper corroborates that the compact city is justified by its ability to contribute to the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability. Nevertheless, the economic goals seem to dominate over the environmental and social goals, notwithstanding the general claim about the three sustainability dimensions being equally important and mutually dependent. Further, this paper reveals that big data technology holds great potential for enhancing compact urbanism with respect to sustainability. This thorough review of and critique on the existing work on the compact city provides a reference for researchers and practitioners in related communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the field of compact urbanism and its relation to data–driven smart urbanism.

Urban shrinkage is typically measured by a decrease in population. However, city activity is usually ignored. Accordingly, this study measured city shrinkage in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River based on whether city activities and population shrank from 2000 to 2010. This study drew on the Cobb-Douglas production function using multiple big data [such as nighttime light (NTL) data, patent data, and land transaction data] to calculate a city activity index to examine city activity. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was applied to explore the influencing factors of city shrinkage. Results showed the following: (1) in the area of study, 14.87% of cities experienced population loss, considering the city activities, an increase in the latter accounted for 57.36% in depopulation cities; (2) urban shrinkage spatial pattern presented the feature of ""overall growth, local shrinkage""; (3) in the urban shrinkage regression model, urban spatial expansion and the increase in secondary industry population were factors that aggravated urban shrinkage. The main influencing factors of city shrinkage in the regions are different and need to be studied in-depth and meticulously in combination with the local development situation.

However, few studies have conceptualized varying regional spatial structure via the network perspective. This study thus develops a complex network approach, particularly by adopting a novel machine-learning-based weighted stochastic block model and visual analytics, to measuring potential spatial mesoscale structures in PRD. We build a finer-grained commuting network with 60 sub-city divisions as nodes by aggregating a large set of mobile phone signaling data collected in 2018. Results detect a hybrid polycentric configuration of two community components, each with a core-periphery structure inside. One community centered on Guangzhou has a semi-core commuting belt alongside the intercity railway and high-speed rails, while the other centered on Shenzhen exhibits a concentric commuting ring. Intercity transport infrastructure, spatial proximity, and regional integration policies appear to play important roles in shaping spatial and network structures in the megaregion, while the constraint of administrative boundary is dissolving.

The spatial linkage intensity of cities in urban agglomeration is an important basis for evaluating the development and compactness of urban agglomerations. The requirements associated with the major national strategy to achieve the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and the research methods made possible by Big Data in the Internet era have created the realistic possibility of revealing the strength of spatial networks and the spatial differentiation rules of urban agglomerations. This study uses Web Crawler to obtain 500,000 sets of Weibo data in 13 cities of the BTH urban agglomeration. Three criteria and nine indicators are used to construct an index system and a model to quantitatively evaluate the strength of spatial networks in the BTH urban agglomeration. The results show that spatial network connections between cities in the urban agglomeration are not strong overall, reflecting the limited development of urban agglomeration; the spatial networks in the urban agglomeration have hierarchical and centralized characteristics, which reflect the imbalanced development of the city network; Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang are the centers of the social network connections in the BTH urban agglomeration, which means that Weibo's online space reinforces the existing urban system; there is a positive correlation between network spatial connectivity and the hierarchy of cities in the urban agglomeration, where cities with higher levels would have more urban network connections; Generally, Weibo network connections are stronger than economic or transport links between the cities, and the development of information technology may reduce the disparity of regional development.

The spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life in Changzhou based on residential environment,Feng J.,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,10.11821/dlxb202006011,18,False,Peking University,Beijing,China,"After the release of the Sixth Census Data, more research results have been achieved about the socio-spatial structure in urban China based on the method of factor ecology analysis. However, methodological innovation needs to be promoted. In this paper, combining census data with big data, with the aid of the methods of grid processing and calculation of accessibility of public service facilities, the authors try to interpret the quality of life of urban residents from both the internal and the external environments of residence, and to reveal the relationship between the spatial structure of quality of life and the socio-economic status of urban residents. Taking Changzhou City of Jiangsu province as a case study, first of all, the authors extract the housing data from the Sixth Census, and the data of facilities from the urban POI data of Baidu maps. And then, factor analysis, cluster analysis, accessibility analysis and other methods are used to identify the spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life and reveal some characteristics of urban social space from the viewpoint of socio-spatial dialectic. The results suggest that the spatial structure of the quality of life of residents in Changzhou based on residential environment shows a clear pattern of overlap between the circular structure and the fan-shaped one. In addition, there is a spatial coupling between the spatial structure of urban residents' quality of life and their socioeconomic attributes, that is, residents with different social and economic attributes have some differences in their quality of life. The formation of an interactive relationship between these two aspects is the result of a combination of administrative, market and spatial factors, which may lead to overcrowding in the old city, fire safety problems in living and production buildings, traffic congestion problems caused by tidal commuting, social isolation, unreasonable distribution of public service facilities, and other socio-spatial effects.

Results showed that the distribution of goods displaceFower law or exponential distribution of human mobility trends. The origin–destination flows of goods were used to build a spatially embedded network, revealing that Hong Kong became increasingly connected through intra-urban freight movement.

Based on spatial statistical analyses, the equipment manufacturing industry and the automobile sales industry in Shenyang City showed a spatial complementary integration, weak spatial correlation, and coordination with scale dependence and spatial heterogeneity in 2018. This distribution characteristic is attributed to: 1) local policy factors (i.e., that industrial land should be located in the periphery of the city or outside the Second Ring Road), and 2) the economic factors (i.e., that the degree of dependence of the equipment manufacturing industry and automobile sales industry were also influenced by external factors such as costs).

Based on a dataset of multisource geographical big data, the understanding and analysis of urban vibrancy can be deepened with fine granularity. The working framework in this study focuses on the comprehensive perspective of urban morphology, which is decomposed into two dimensions (formality and functionality) and four elements (road, block, building, point of interest). The geographically and temporally weighted regression model was first applied to determine the spatiotemporal effect of the morphological metrics on vibrancy, and then, the geographical detector was employed from the perspective of spatially stratified heterogeneity to reveal the synergetic impacts. The following findings were revealed. (1) Dense street networks, small and medium-sized blocks, and the diversification and intensification of building and land use are beneficial to urban vibrancy. (2) Under the premise of adapting to local conditions, urban spaces combine multiple morphological metrics for the accomplishment of a full-region and all-time vibrancy. (3) The mixture of urban functions is worthy of attention for vibrancy growth because of its extraordinary synergy, not its capacity.

Delineating urban park catchment areas using mobile phone data: A case study of Tokyo,Guan C.H.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101474,43,True,NYU Shanghai,Shanghai,China,"Urban parks can offer both physical and psychological health benefits to urban dwellers and provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to society. Earlier research on the usage of urban parks relied on fixed distance or walking time to delineate urban park catchment areas. However, actual catchment areas can be affected by many factors other than park surface areas, such as social capital cultivation, cultural adaptation, climate and seasonal variation, and park function and facilities provided. This study advanced this method by using mobile phone data to delineate urban park catchment area. The study area is the 23 special wards of Tokyo or tokubetsu-ku, the core of the capital of Japan. The location data of over 1 million anonymous mobile phone users was collected in 2011. The results show that: (1) the park catchment areas vary significantly by park surface areas: people use smaller parks nearby but also travel further to larger parks; (2) even for the parks in the same size category, there are notable differences in the spatial pattern of visitors, which cannot be simply summarized with average distance or catchment radius; and (3) almost all the parks, regardless of its size and function, had the highest user density right around the vicinity, exemplified by the density-distance function closely follow a decay trend line within 1–2 km radius of the park. As such, this study used the density threshold and density-distance function to measure park catchment. We concluded that the application of mobile phone location data can improve our understanding of an urban park catchment area, provide useful information and methods to analyze the usage of urban parks, and can aid in the planning and policy-making of urban parks.","['can', 'not', 'social', 'walking', 'visitors', 'use', 'method', 'almost', 'nearby', 'regardless', 'delineate', 'analyze', 'vary', 'million', 'improve', 'users', 'time', 'surface', 'line', 'japan', 'climate', 'right', 'closely', 'society', 'special', 'core', 'psychological', 'radius', 'densitydistance', 'even', 'location', 'collected', 'exemplified', 'trend', 'anonymous', 'affected', 'provide', 'policymaking', 'concluded', 'economic', 'category', 'actual', 'usage', 'follow', 'summarized', 'measure', 'parks', 'areas', 'cultivation', 'capital', 'around', 'benefits', 'average', 'user', 'show', 'fixed', 'park', 'many', 'seasonal', 'relied', 'tokubetsuku', 'factors', 'advanced', 'health', 'vicinity', 'function', 'useful', 'significantly', 'simply', 'within', 'offer', 'travel', 'provided', 'decay', 'aid', 'wards', 'tokyo', 'people', 'variation', 'smaller', 'highest', 'larger', 'mobile', 'phone', 'area', 'notable', 'size', 'environmental', 'density', 'physical', 'km', 'pattern', 'catchment', 'facilities', 'cultural', 'adaptation', 'distance', 'dwellers', 'differences', 'earlier', 'threshold']",2020,"[(0, 0.34327072), (1, 0.6557151)]"
Spatial pattern of intercity less-than-truckload logistics networks in China,Ren M.,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,10.11821/dlxb202004011,14,False,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,"Freight logistics is one of the most important socioeconomic connection elements between regions. The intercity logistics connection is an important perspective to understand regional production-consumption relationship and urban spatial structure. However, due to the lack of data and methods, few studies can effectively reveal the intercity logistics network pattern at the nation level. With the development and application of Internet and data science, the logistics resources and data integrated by the fourth party logistics platform provide new data source and research foundation for logistics studies. Drawing online less-than-truckload logistics transaction data for 3 months from November 2017 to January 2018, from the largest 4th party logistics (4PL) platform in China, this research aims to explore the intercity logistics connection pattern and urban logistics function differences. The outbound and inbound transaction numbers were calculated first for each prefecture-level city. With the approach of social network analysis (SNA), the logistics connection intensity and corresponding centrality were then computed and visualized for each city in the network. The research results show that: (1) the intercity logistics landscape roughly coincides with interregional socio-economic development. Taking three metropolises (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta) as core triangle corridors, the national logistics connection pattern decreases from coastal area to inland areas. (2) Logistics activities are characterized by significant cross-regional flow. Active are intercity logistics shipment activities within the threshold of 1200 km distance. (3) According to the less-than-truckload logistics (LTL) network pattern, cities in China could be further divided into five categories, namely the national primary logistics city, national logistics center cities, national logistics node cities, regional logistics center cities and local logistics cities. These conclusions are expected to, from the perspective of intercity logistics connections, support national, provincial and city governments to make spatial planning and logistics planning.","['interregional', 'new', 'social', 'decreases', 'delta', 'beijingtianjinhebei', 'relationship', 'sna', 'ie', 'conclusions', 'aims', 'structure', 'five', 'expected', 'river', 'corridors', 'numbers', 'cities', 'corresponding', 'months', 'active', 'nation', 'core', 'largest', 'resources', 'elements', 'lessthantruckload', 'productionconsumption', 'provincial', 'regions', 'triangle', 'three', 'november', 'significant', 'effectively', 'due', 'provide', 'drawing', 'understand', 'freight', 'could', 'network', 'characterized', 'integrated', 'areas', 'prefecturelevel', 'shipment', 'coincides', 'show', 'january', 'perspective', 'connection', 'internet', 'important', 'one', 'metropolises', 'studies', 'national', 'ltl', 'yangtze', 'roughly', 'local', 'center', 'socioeconomic', 'connections', 'governments', 'function', 'intensity', 'pearl', 'within', 'online', 'centrality', 'coastal', 'activities', 'science', 'fourth', 'computed', 'landscape', 'according', 'primary', 'transaction', 'lack', 'calculated', 'city', 'platform', 'party', 'node', 'area', 'taking', 'source', 'crossregional', 'flow', 'explore', 'inbound', 'intercity', 'divided', 'first', 'km', 'pattern', 'logistics', 'support', 'visualized', 'distance', 'make', 'foundation', 'reveal', 'level', 'differences', 'categories', 'regional', 'outbound', 'threshold', 'namely', 'inland']",2020,"[(1, 0.9987852)]"

Does high-speed rail influence urban dynamics and land pricing?,Rungskunroch P.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su12073012,26,True,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,United States,"At present, many countries around the world have significantly invested in sustainable transportation systems, especially for high-speed rail (HSR) infrastructures, since they are believed to improve economies, and regenerate regional and business growth. In this study, we focus on economic growth, dynamic land use, and urban mobility. The emphasis is placed on testing a hypothesis about whether HSRs can enable socio-economic development. Real case studies using big data from large cities in China, namely Shanghai province and Minhang districts, are taken into account. Socio-technical information such as employment rate, property pricing, and agglomeration in the country's economy is collected from the China Statistics Bureau and the China Academy of Railway Sciences for analyses. This research aims to re-examine practical factors resulting from HSR's impact on urban areas by using ANOVA analysis and dummy variable regression to analyse urban dynamics and property pricing. In addition, this study enhances the prediction outcomes that lead to urban planning strategies for the business area. The results reveal that there are various effects (i.e., regional accessibility, city development plans, and so on) required to enable the success of HSR infrastructure in order to enrich urban dynamics and land pricing.

Currently, existing research and applications of smart city evaluation are still in the exploration stage.

Based on a common and shareable smart city framework, this paper proposes a well-integrated, universal, strongly practical, and highly extensible evaluation system. Then, using the above-mentioned evaluation system, 17 smart cities in China are assessed. This application demonstrates that the evaluation system plays an important guiding role for better understanding the overall smart city platform construction situation in China, performing horizontal comparisons and establishing benchmarks among smart cities.

The varying patterns of rail transit ridership and their relationships with fine-scale built environment factors: Big data analytics from Guangzhou,Li S.,Cities,10.1016/j.cities.2019.102580,98,False,Guangzhou University,Guangzhou,China,"Investigating the varying ridership patterns of rail transit ridership and their influencing factors at the station level is essential for station planning, urban planning, and passenger flow management. Although many studies have investigated the associations between rail transit ridership and built environment, few studies combined spatial big data to characterize the built environment factors at a fine scale and linked those factors with the varying patterns of rail transit ridership. In this study, we characterized the fine-scale built environment factors in the central urban area of Guangzhou, China, by integrating multi-source geospatial big data including Tencent user data, building footprint and stories, points of interest (POI) data and Google Earth high-resolution images. Six direct ridership models (DRMs) based on the backward stepwise regression method were built to compare the different effects between daily, temporal and directional ridership. The results indicated that number of station entrances/exits and transfer dummy, were positively associated with rail transit ridership, while connecting bus station sites and the parking lots were not significantly related to ridership. Population density and common residences land were found to be dominating factors in promoting morning boarding & evening alighting ridership, which implied that these two factors should be focused on to encourage commuting-purpose rail transit usage. However, the indistinct effect of urban villages on rail transit ridership suggested planners to pay more attentions on urban regeneration at the pedestrian catchment areas (PCAs) with urban villages. High employment density and a large FAR were suggested at the employment-oriented areas owing to their importance in promoting rail transit ridership, especially the morning alighting & evening boarding ridership. Moreover, educational research land use significantly affected weekday ridership while sports land use positively influenced weekend ridership, which suggested planners to pay more attention on the non-commuting trips. The different influencing mechanisms of various types of rail transit ridership highlighted the need to consider land use balance planning and trip demand optimization in highly urbanized metropolises in developing countries.","['models', 'noncommuting', 'patterns', 'management', 'points', 'number', 'large', 'common', 'use', 'method', 'influencing', 'high', 'positively', 'owing', 'bus', 'essential', 'promoting', 'varying', 'various', 'associated', 'scale', 'investigated', 'compare', 'rail', 'footprint', 'ridership', 'highlighted', 'two', 'morning', 'temporal', 'including', 'direct', 'geospatial', 'multisource', 'population', 'residences', 'demand', 'highly', 'pay', 'stories', 'affected', 'need', 'found', 'finescale', 'pedestrian', 'influenced', 'central', 'entrancesexits', 'villages', 'urbanized', 'characterized', 'usage', 'evening', 'sports', 'directional', 'areas', 'fine', 'dummy', 'indicated', 'types', 'developing', 'commutingpurpose', 'trips', 'user', 'weekday', 'weekend', 'sites', 'associations', 'regression', 'transfer', 'importance', 'related', 'metropolises', 'studies', 'backward', 'tencent', 'factors', 'station', 'balance', 'built', 'planners', 'optimization', 'encourage', 'parking', 'significantly', 'indistinct', 'educational', 'six', 'boarding', 'land', 'highresolution', 'drms', 'attentions', 'effects', 'lots', 'daily', 'employment', 'google', 'countries', 'attention', 'consider', 'focused', 'interest', 'area', 'combined', 'linked', 'suggested', 'investigating', 'flow', 'density', 'connecting', 'dominating', 'trip', 'building', 'alighting', 'passenger', 'far', 'catchment', 'pcas', 'different', 'regeneration', 'mechanisms', 'guangzhou', 'effect', 'earth', 'although', 'stepwise', 'integrating', 'employmentoriented', 'characterize', 'moreover', 'poi', 'implied', 'environment', 'images', 'level', 'especially', 'transit', 'many']",2020,"[(1, 0.99900323)]"
Evaluation of plan implementation in the fast-growing Chinese Mega-City: A case of a polycentric system in Hangzhou core built-up area,Ding L.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su12051723,2,True,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou,China,"Previous evaluations of plan implementation focused on whether the materiality construction was in accordance with the plan. Without proper data, it is difficult to confirm whether the planning goals have been achieved. In this study, two types of big data have been used-full sample built-environment data and mobile-positioning big data-to evaluate the results of the implementation of the polycentric system in master planning in the Hangzhou core built-up area. Using the full sample built-environment data, the evaluation of materiality construction will be more objective and accurate. Using the mobile-positioning big data, the evaluation of the planning goals can be realized; this was almost impossible in the past. However, two aspects are considered: whether daily public activities, such as employment and recreation, have been dispersed from the old city and subsequently re-gathered in multiple centers outside the old city, and whether the polycentric system aids in optimizing the spatial relationship between residence and public activity. The following conclusions were drawn. In terms of actual materiality construction, the results showed minimal discrepancy from the plan. Fifteen city-level public centers have been constructed at principal, secondary, and sub-secondary levels. However, the polycentric system failed to achieve the expected effects of the planning goals. First, the public centers contributed in the gathering of public activities; however, the level of gathering at the newly built-up public centers was considerably lower than that at traditional public centers. Second, the public centers failed to encourage people to visit the nearest blocks for daily public activities, mainly because of the path dependence on the traditional centers in the process of multi-centralization and over-rapid expansion of the city. Owing to this, residents did not have sufficient time to adjust to the spatial relationship between the residence and daily public activities.","['outside', 'almost', 'hangzhou', 'relationship', 'overrapid', 'drawn', 'conclusions', 'owing', 'regathered', 'time', 'expected', 'goals', 'considered', 'multicentralization', 'optimizing', 'traditional', 'following', 'core', 'aids', 'two', 'second', 'subsequently', 'contributed', 'levels', 'newly', 'confirm', 'discrepancy', 'dispersed', 'realized', 'aspects', 'whether', 'impossible', 'accordance', 'accurate', 'actual', 'showed', 'full', 'implementation', 'terms', 'multiple', 'achieved', 'types', 'previous', 'expansion', 'materiality', 'public', 'old', 'minimal', 'nearest', 'principal', 'mainly', 'constructed', 'evaluations', 'residence', 'difficult', 'polycentric', 'secondary', 'past', 'lower', 'encourage', 'path', 'achieve', 'builtup', 'people', 'activities', 'visit', 'subsecondary', 'effects', 'sample', 'daily', 'employment', 'city', 'considerably', 'focused', 'blocks', 'area', 'dependence', 'construction', 'failed', 'builtenvironment', 'citylevel', 'datato', 'objective', 'plan', 'without', 'first', 'master', 'centers', 'residents', 'evaluate', 'gathering', 'usedfull', 'fifteen', 'sufficient', 'system', 'adjust', 'proper', 'activity', 'recreation', 'level', 'mobilepositioning']",2020,"[(1, 0.5885027), (2, 0.41060814)]"
Multiscale identification of urban functional polycentricity for planning implications: An integrated approach using geo-big transport data and complex network modeling,Wei L.,Habitat International,10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102134,52,False,"Institutionen för Naturgeografi och Ekosystemvetenskap, Lunds Universitet",Lund,Sweden,"Polycentrism has gradually become a newly emergent dimension of global urbanization. Many countries worldwide have tailored plans suited to functional polycentricity, in light of the prevalent “ghost cities” or “empty towns” as lessons from the morphologically polycentric development practices. However, the subject of defining and measuring functional polycentricity is still in an initial development phase, both in theory and in methodology. This paper first establishes a general theoretical framework for understanding functional polycentricity from the lens of interactive human mobility among spatial units. Then, a new approach is proposed to identify and measure urban functional polycentricity from a multiscale perspective and further applied to the case of Shanghai, China. More specifically, the pick-up and drop-off points from taxi GPS data are used to examine the linkages among different urban units across various scales (e.g., census tract, 3000-m grid, 5000-m grid, and community). Complex network modeling, together with the sensitivity analysis, is further employed to identify the centers according to the spatial importance of each unit. The results show that (1) the approach proposed can effectively identify functional centers within urban setting; (2) an obvious polycentric structure exists in Shanghai and is sensitive to scale effects; (3) the estimates are more accurate and precise with the shrink of analysis unit size from community level to census tract level; and (4) under the same spatial scale, the grid-based analysis produces a more elaborated polycentric pattern compared with the traditional administration-based analysis. Finally, scale-dependent differences between morphological and functional polycentricity are distinguished for providing implications for urban planning.

Portraying the spatial dynamics of urban vibrancy using multisource urban big data,Tu W.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101428,154,False,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China,"Understanding urban vibrancy aids policy-making to foster urban space and therefore has long been a goal of urban studies. Recently, the emerging urban big data and urban analytic methods have enabled us to portray citywide vibrancy. From the social sensing perspective, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative framework to cross-validate urban vibrancy and uncover associated spatial effects. Spatial patterns of urban vibrancy indicated by multisource urban sensing data (points-of-interest, social media check-ins, and mobile phone records) were investigated. A comprehensive urban vibrancy metric was formed by adaptively weighting these metrics. The association between urban vibrancy and demographic, economic, and built environmental factors was revealed with global regression models and local regression models. An empirical experiment was conducted in Shenzhen. The results demonstrate that four urban vibrancy metrics are all higher in the special economic zone (SEZ) and lower in non-SEZs but with different degrees of spatial aggregation. The influences of employment and road density on all vibrancy metrics are significant and positive. However, the effects of metro stations, land use mix, building footprints, and distance to district center depend on the vibrancy indicator and location. These findings unravel the commonalities and differences in urban vibrancy metrics derived from multisource urban big data and the hidden spatial dynamics of the influences of associated factors. They further suggest that urban policies should be proposed to foster vibrancy in Shenzhen therefore benefit social wellbeing and urban development in the long term.

RESEARCH on INTELLIGENT RECOGNITION of VIOLATION BASED on BIG DATA of URBAN CONSTRUCTION,Li B.S.,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W10-721-2020,1,True,Guilin University of Technology,Guilin,China,"With the rapid development of market economy and the continuous improvement of urbanization process in China, housing construction in almost all areas of densely populated cities has shown explosive growth. The existence of illegal construction, to a certain extent, not only causes the waste of land and resources, but also leads to the increase of the cost of the development of affordable housing, but also increases the security risks. It is urgent to solve the common problem of urban disease in violation of construction, but the conventional means of monitoring illegal construction mainly rely on on on-site inspection by law enforcement departments and mass reporting. Due to the limited inspection power and time, there are inevitably omissions. At the same time, there are difficulties in obtaining evidence in violation of construction investigation. Therefore, a new type of monitoring method is urgently needed. There is a wide market demand in China's urban management departments and land and resources departments for automated monitoring methods to reduce the cost of urban management. In this paper, urban spatial geographic information is acquired by means of remote sensing change detection, and compared with urban construction land planning approval data, including illegal matching recognition algorithm. Based on the technology of automatic urban change detection of grid image blocks, an efficient algorithm for building change detection is proposed. Establish a threshold recognition and accuracy test algorithm of urban building construction progress model parameters, and obtain information of illegal building construction progress and area based on grid image blocks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to identify and extract buildings from satellite remote sensing images in different time periods. The dynamic change information of the research area is reflected by multi-source and large data integration technology of satellite and UAV remote sensing.

DYNAMIC MONITORING METHOD of ILLEGAL BUILDINGS USING SPATIOTEMPORAL BIG DATA BASED on URBAN HIGH LYING ZONES,Li B.S.,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W10-17-2020,1,True,Guilin University of Technology,Guilin,China,"China's urban illegal buildings are emerging in an endless stream with a large number. There is a wide demand for urban illegal buildings monitoring in urban management departments, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other regions where urban management is facing increasingly serious problems of illegal buildings. It is urgent to solve the common problem of urban disease caused by urban illegal buildings, and a new automatic monitoring method that can reduce the cost of urban management is urgently needed. This kind of automated monitoring method of illegal buildings has a wide market demand in Urban Management and Law Enforcement and the Ministry of Land and Resources. Existing technologies cannot realize long-term, autonomous, rapid and intelligent dynamic real-time monitoring of urban illegal buildings, which leads to the problem that illegal buildings' behaviors cannot be stopped in time. There is a possibility to solve these problems using the ubiquitous network of base stations in cities to monitor illegal buildings.This paper proposes a dynamic monitoring method of illegal buildings using spatiotemporal big data based on urban high lying zones. Through the Spatiotemporal sensor network technology, the tilt-type stereo camera is set up at the high lying zones around the survey area. According to the real-time ambient temperature and humidity numerical data fed back by the temperature and humidity sensor, the tilt-type stereo camera uses intelligent time-lapse photogrammetry technology to obtain multiple stereo pairs. The tilted remote sensor transmits the multiple stereo pairs to the urban dynamic analysis service network using wireless transmission. The urban dynamic analysis service network will complete a series of analysis and processing operations without any human intervention, and then transmit the results of the analysis to the early-warning terminal successively through the base station, WIFI and other wireless transmission methods. Finally, the illegal building data is uploaded to the terminal. That is to say, the urban dynamic analysis service network can realize the intelligent, automatic analysis and processing of spatial analysis server and the operation of calling all database data and storing data.The method proposed in this paper uses the high lying zones around the survey area to expand the monitoring range, improve the accuracy of monitoring data, realize long-term real-time monitoring, and fully utilize the characteristics of Spatiotemporal sensing network technology intelligent, autonomous, wireless transmission, etc., significantly reducing labor. It greatly shortens the process from the emergence to the discovery of illegal buildings in cities. The workload of monitoring has improved the efficiency of dynamic monitoring and warehousing of illegal buildings data in cities.","['facing', 'earlywarning', 'can', 'not', 'management', 'new', 'number', 'existing', 'shortens', 'large', 'common', 'method', 'ubiquitous', 'urgently', 'high', 'human', 'set', 'improve', 'time', 'efficiency', 'photogrammetry', 'buildings', 'reduce', 'uploaded', 'stream', 'rapid', 'warehousing', 'behaviors', 'greatly', 'complete', 'cities', 'finally', 'workload', 'proposed', 'service', 'needed', 'wireless', 'monitoring', 'urgent', 'possibility', 'resources', 'longterm', 'back', 'caused', 'automatic', 'buildingsthis', 'including', 'series', 'numerical', 'range', 'regions', 'remote', 'wide', 'realtime', 'reducing', 'beijing', 'demand', 'problems', 'storing', 'say', 'expand', 'increasingly', 'technology', 'dynamic', 'calling', 'network', 'utilize', 'stations', 'tilttype', 'enforcement', 'law', 'fed', 'successively', 'problem', 'around', 'illegal', 'multiple', 'operation', 'emergence', 'wifi', 'sensing', 'base', 'transmits', 'intervention', 'chinas', 'transmission', 'cost', 'camera', 'technologies', 'automated', 'leads', 'survey', 'ambient', 'ministry', 'stereo', 'station', 'fully', 'significantly', 'serious', 'obtain', 'proposes', 'server', 'temperature', 'emerging', 'land', 'sensor', 'according', 'database', 'intelligent', 'humidity', 'datathe', 'realize', 'stopped', 'zones', 'uses', 'kind', 'monitor', 'area', 'lying', 'tilted', 'endless', 'operations', 'characteristics', 'departments', 'market', 'without', 'building', 'autonomous', 'spatiotemporal', 'solve', 'guangzhou', 'transmit', 'shanghai', 'processing', 'pairs', 'accuracy', 'improved', 'discovery', 'timelapse', 'labor', 'disease', 'terminal', 'etc']",2020,"[(1, 0.83775705), (2, 0.1616145)]"
Associations of spatial aggregation between neighborhood facilities and the population of age groups based on points-of-interest data,Jia Y.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su12041692,2,True,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"By actively adapting urban planning to identified social needs, residential areas tend to be more people-oriented, fairer, resource-saving, and sustainable. The emergence of big data has provided new opportunities for the planning of residential urban areas. Since the quantity and age-appropriateness of neighborhood facilities are important criteria when developing the ideal neighborhood, this study investigated the associations of the number of neighborhood facilities and the age groups within those neighborhoods by using the Wuhan metropolitan area in China as a case study and by applying a Geodetector and regression analysis to points-of-interest data. In terms of age groups, the neighborhood facilities of kindergartens, pharmacies, and bus stations were found to be highly associated with population size, regardless of the age difference. It was also found that convenience stores were closely related to the adult population, and that convenience stores, community hospitals or clinics, and vegetable markets or fresh supermarkets were associated with the elderly population. Facilities without significant correlations were equally important, but it was found that there was no statistical correlation between the number of facilities and the distribution of the population. The weak association of key educational resources and medical resources with the population indicates a concentrated distribution of educational resources and medical resources, and the latent insufficiency of schools, community hospitals, or clinics at some neighborhoods. It concludes that planning of neighborhood facilities for residential areas in Wuhan requires optimization in terms of matching the provision of facilities with population size and social structure. Furthermore, more efforts should be put into supplementing important facilities and building differentiated residential area programs based on age structure.","['community', 'social', 'number', 'new', 'case', 'regardless', 'structure', 'bus', 'associated', 'quantity', 'investigated', 'peopleoriented', 'closely', 'neighborhoods', 'schools', 'correlation', 'weak', 'resourcesaving', 'clinics', 'resources', 'since', 'sustainable', 'population', 'highly', 'hospitals', 'significant', 'supplementing', 'equally', 'criteria', 'found', 'concludes', 'requires', 'stations', 'kindergartens', 'areas', 'concentrated', 'put', 'ageappropriateness', 'residential', 'emergence', 'geodetector', 'terms', 'supermarkets', 'developing', 'fresh', 'important', 'elderly', 'associations', 'convenience', 'regression', 'indicates', 'related', 'actively', 'wuhan', 'markets', 'metropolitan', 'matching', 'key', 'association', 'fairer', 'optimization', 'correlations', 'within', 'educational', 'provided', 'applying', 'pointsofinterest', 'programs', 'needs', 'identified', 'age', 'distribution', 'groups', 'insufficiency', 'provision', 'difference', 'furthermore', 'vegetable', 'area', 'latent', 'size', 'tend', 'neighborhood', 'pharmacies', 'without', 'building', 'stores', 'efforts', 'facilities', 'adult', 'adapting', 'statistical', 'differentiated', 'medical', 'ideal', 'opportunities']",2020,"[(1, 0.9985577)]"

The research found that: 1)The area of high-frequency activity area on working day is obviously higher than that of rest day and holiday. The larger the thermal value of the classification interval is, the smaller the number of pixels is. 2)There are four kinds of condensed structures of urban activity space in the study area, namely ""mononuclear structure"", ""dual-core structure"", ""trinuclear structure"" and ""aggregate structure"". Each structure has unique morphological characteristics and representativeness. 3)Divide the study area into six kinds of activity space function zoning: comprehensive activity area, residential area, learning activity area, leisure and entertainment area, transportation hub area, employment area, and different activity patterns correspond to their respective activities frequency changes. Using the method of superposition analysis, the core area and the marginal area of the six functional modes are divided. 4)The activity function areas in the study area are unevenly distributed. Most of the activity types are residential activity areas and learning activity areas. 5)According to the distribution characteristics of the activity space structure and the distribution characteristics of the activity area discovered by big data mining, combined with the urban development plan of Nanchang City, the current activity space structure of Nanchang City was evaluated, and based on the above analysis, we made some recommendations on improving the planning of the city.","['morphological', 'mining', 'patterns', 'number', 'discovered', 'method', 'structure', 'hub', 'heat', 'zoning', 'day', 'core', 'cohesion', 'holidays', 'kinds', 'trinuclear', 'days', 'temporal', 'peak', 'location', 'three', 'respective', 'four', 'distributed', 'made', 'found', 'superposition', 'higher', 'correspond', 'times', 'obviously', 'nanchang', 'holiday', 'interval', 'entertainment', 'unevenly', 'space', 'areas', 'pixels', 'dualcore', 'residential', 'types', 'value', 'rest', 'analyzed', 'tencent', 'polygon', 'leisure', 'transportation', 'specific', 'function', 'learning', 'six', 'activities', 'variation', 'unique', 'smaller', 'aggregate', 'point', 'changes', 'employment', 'distribution', 'city', 'thermal', 'frequency', 'larger', 'comprehensive', 'representativeness', 'area', 'combined', 'marginal', 'density', 'modes', 'plan', 'characteristics', 'tyson', 'functional', 'divided', 'improving', 'studied', 'first', 'recommendations', 'condensed', 'highfrequency', 'different', 'extraction', 'mononuclear', 'nuclear', 'current', 'structures', 'evaluated', 'working', 'activity', 'namely', 'classification']",2020,"[(1, 0.9985427)]"
In support of sustainable densification in urban planning: a proposed framework for utilising CCTV for propagation of human energy from movement within urban spaces,Jonescu E.,"Urban, Planning and Transport Research",10.1080/21650020.2019.1703800,1,True,Curtin University,Perth,Australia,"Co-generation of energy derived from human movement is not new. Intentionally accumulating energy, from mass urban-mobility, provides opportunities to re-purpose power. However, when mass-mobility is predictable, yet not harnessed, this highlights critical gaps in application of interdisciplinary knowledge.

Where clear urban spatio-behavioural relationships of density and movement can be predicted–understanding such patterns supports cross-disciplinary city planning and decision-making. A data-informed–predictive spatial decision-making framework is proposed–facilitating the endeavour of cogenerating kinetic human energy within a prescribed space.

Space science, technology and its applications can provide a wide range of solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thus contribute to achieving economic, social and environmental sustainable development. This paper addresses the contributions of space activities from three different perspectives: policy, strategy and technology. It focuses on a sub-set of challenges linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely global health, water, energy and urban development. The proposed strategy perspective considers elements, such as interdisciplinarity, spin-in and spin-off transfers, open innovation processes, and sustainability at large. Space exploration programmes are usually conceived around space mission requirements and technologies with a maturity level that allows for their implementation into planned technology roadmaps. Therefore, it is discussed how such roadmaps could better integrate policy and strategic aspects linked to sustainability on Earth. What if a system is efficiently designed to operate in space and at the same time allows for sustainable development on Earth? The further integration of key enabling technologies (big data, artificial intelligence systems, advanced robotics) are opening a new era in the exploration of other planets where autonomy is an essential requirement. At the same time such developments can become an integral part of the future developments on Earth, providing smart solutions to the citizens of tomorrow and opening up new business sectors associated to these spin-offs.

However, it will also open up new ways of thinking on a large scale, for instance in the construction of buildings and structures using local materials, such as Moon regolith or Earth sand. Other examples are In Situ Resource Utilisation and viewing a building or a city as a spaceship system, which will not only allow space habitats to include self-regenerative functions, but also allow smart cities on Earth to become greener and more sustainable, especially in view of the expansion of population, the resulting densification and increase of urban areas.

Taking the main urban area of Urumqi City as the case study area, using 136975 business-related points of interest (POIs) including six types of businesses in 2018 and open street map (OSM) road network, and based on head/tail division rule, this study identified high-density commercial parcels and used kernel density estimation to estimate the core region of business activities. The Getis-Ord G* method was used to identify the overall and different types of commercial hot spot areas. Geographic detector analysis was performed to explore the determinants of overall and different types of commercial site distribution in Urumqi, and Pearson correlation coefficient matrix of commercial sites was established to estimate the impact of the combination and coordination of business forms on commercial space. The findings of this study suggest that the key features of high-density commercial parcel distribution are central-peripheral, separated by highways and internal loops; the number of high value parcels from the center to the peripheral area reduces progressively; and the distribution of the six types of commercial sites varies. Commercial zone presents multi-core distribution characteristics, the agglomeration characteristic is apparent in the urban center region, and the northern commercial agglomeration is gradually becoming obvious. There are six main commercial centers including Nanhu, Zhongshan Road, Youhao, Huizhan Center, Midong New Area, and Tieluju. Tuwu Expressway and Wukui Expressway together constitute the two axes of commercial hotspots. Hotspots of the six types of commercial sites can be divided into three spatial structures. Business and finance show a single-center distribution trend; accommodation and food & restraurant are of banded extension type; while services and shopping spots are of banded dual-core type. The primary determinants of the spatial distribution of commercial sites are: land price, agglomeration effect, and road network density. The influence of population and central accessibility is secondary; elevation has no significant effect. In particular, for business and financial services, land price and center accessibility are the main factors affecting the distribution. Accommodation and food & restraurant are affected by road network density. Shopping and services are significantly affected by population density. Business and finance sites, food & restraurant and shopping sites all have strong synergistic effects on the formation of urban commercial space, while others are not significance.","['points', 'new', 'number', 'case', 'method', 'restraurant', 'constitute', 'high', 'analyze', 'structure', 'open', 'hot', 'essential', 'map', 'division', 'therefore', 'together', 'banded', 'hotspots', 'axes', 'accommodation', 'cities', 'zone', 'forms', 'characteristic', 'vitality', 'correlation', 'core', 'nanhu', 'suggest', 'performed', 'resources', 'youhao', 'two', 'presents', 'quantitatively', 'including', 'pois', 'trend', 'centralperipheral', 'extension', 'population', 'matrix', 'three', 'formation', 'headtail', 'significant', 'parcel', 'affected', 'street', 'combination', 'estimate', 'becoming', 'central', 'determinants', 'road', 'network', 'rule', 'businessrelated', 'accessibility', 'space', 'reduces', 'areas', 'affecting', 'dualcore', 'tuwu', 'strong', 'separated', 'types', 'vital', 'loops', 'estimation', 'midong', 'show', 'value', 'g', 'food', 'financial', 'multicore', 'type', 'sites', 'internal', 'others', 'coordination', 'detector', 'price', 'elevation', 'factors', 'tieluju', 'kernel', 'center', 'key', 'urumqi', 'spot', 'secondary', 'shopping', 'main', 'established', 'synergistic', 'significantly', 'geographic', 'six', 'obvious', 'agglomeration', 'apparent', 'finance', 'activities', 'progressively', 'land', 'overall', 'spots', 'primary', 'particular', 'identified', 'commercial', 'orderly', 'northern', 'effects', 'influence', 'peripheral', 'city', 'businesses', 'distribution', 'expressway', 'parcels', 'wukui', 'interest', 'area', 'taking', 'business', 'getisord', 'highdensity', 'density', 'facilitate', 'configuration', 'osm', 'explore', 'features', 'optimize', 'varies', 'characteristics', 'pearson', 'divided', 'centers', 'region', 'identify', 'different', 'highways', 'effect', 'singlecenter', 'structures', 'significance', 'gradually', 'coefficient', 'services', 'site', 'huizhan', 'zhongshan']",2020,"[(1, 0.9991228)]"

As such the current study investigated the spatial-temporal usage patterns of bikeshare by visitors to an urban community using GPS based big data (N = 353,733). The results revealed differential usage patterns between visitors and local residents based on user provided ZIP Codes using a 50 mile geometric circular buffer around the urban destination. The visitors and residents significantly varied on numerous trip behaviors including route selection, time of rental, checkout/check-in locations, distance, speed, duration, and physical activity intensity.

The comparative analysis investigates the spatial pattern of commute mode preference by taxi at a fine resolution in Beijing. This work indicates how the preference for taxis can be seen in the north-east of the inner city, but not around employment centres.

A study on spatial and temporal aggregation patterns of urban population in Wuhan city based on baidu heat Map and POI Data,Shi P.,International Review for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development,10.14246/irspsda.8.3_101,23,True,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"Advanced technologies and big data have brought new visions and methods to urban planning research. Based on the Baidu heat map and POI data of two typical days (a weekend day and a workday) in 2018, this paper analyses the spatial and temporal aggregation patterns of crowds in the urban centre of Wuhan using ArcGIS. Aggregation patterns are defined by the intensity of population activities and the places where crowds gather. In terms of time, the daily change of population aggregation intensity is studied by counting the heat value of 24 moments captured throughout the day. The results show that on rest days, people prefer to travel around noon and in the afternoon, reaching the highest peak of the day around 15:00, while on workdays, residents' activities are affected by commuting, with obvious 'morning rush hours' and 'evening rush hours'. Firstly, the spatial correlation between the density of POI distribution and the degree of population aggregation has been studied by the spatial coupling relationship between the Baidu heat map and POI data. Secondly, the index of correlation between the aggregation of different POIs and population (ICPP) are mentioned to analyse the purposes and the degrees of aggregation during weekend and workday rush hours.

Digital excavation of mediatized urban heritage: Automated recognition of buildings in image sources,Mager T.,Urban Planning,10.17645/UP.V5I2.3096,6,True,Faculteit Bouwkunde van de TU Delft,Delft,Netherlands,"Digital technologies provide novel ways of visualizing cities and buildings. They also facilitate new methods of analyzing the built environment, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to crowdsourced citizen participation. Digital representations of cities have become so refined that they challenge our perception of the real. However, computers have not yet become able to detect and analyze the visible features of built structures depicted in photographs or other media. Recent scientific advances mean that it is possible for this new field of computer vision to serve as a critical aid to research. Neural networks now meet the challenge of identifying and analyzing building elements, buildings and urban landscapes. The development and refinement of these technologies requires more attention, simultaneously, investigation is needed in regard to the use and meaning of these methods for historical research. For example, the use of AI raises questions about the ways in which computer-based image recognition reproduces biases of contemporary practice. It also invites reflection on how mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, can be established and used in research in the humanities. Finally, it opens new perspectives on the role of crowdsourcing in both knowledge dissemination and shared research. Attempts to analyze historical big data with the latest methods of deep learning, to involve many people—laymen and experts—in research via crowdsourcing and to deal with partly unknown visual material have provided a better understanding of what is possible.

Indeed, it is useful to develop the proposed architecture based on Big Data. This study highlights the opportunities offered when they are combined together to provide a reliable system for saving energy in smart cities. Practical implications: The significant advancement of contemporary applications (smart cities, social networks, health care, IoT, etc.) requires a vast emergence of Big Data and semantics technologies in these fields. The obtained results provide an improved vision of energy-saving and environmental protection while keeping the inhabitants’ comfort. Originality/value: This work is an efficient contribution that provides more comprehensive solutions to ontology integration in the Big Data environment. We have used all available data to reduce energy consumption, promote the change of inhabitant’s behavior, offer the required comfort, and implement an effective long-term energy policy in a smart and sustainable environment.","['social', 'multiagent', 'systems', 'practical', 'aims', 'consumption', 'integration', 'improve', 'various', 'indeed', 'implications', 'reduce', 'inhabitants', 'works', 'together', 'smart', 'cities', 'contribution', 'proposed', 'ontology', 'cooperation', 'reliable', 'longterm', 'role', 'vast', 'sustainable', 'keeping', 'effective', 'homes', 'significant', 'implement', 'provide', 'offered', 'strength', 'end', 'highlights', 'requires', 'presented', 'shows', 'propose', 'emergence', 'provides', 'paradigms', 'behavior', 'required', 'semantics', 'solutions', 'obtained', 'technologies', 'protection', 'reviews', 'care', 'health', 'available', 'seek', 'reach', 'useful', 'ontologies', 'offer', 'overview', 'clarify', 'energy', 'develop', 'work', 'purpose', 'policy', 'vision', 'comprehensive', 'furthermore', 'applications', 'potential', 'semantic', 'originalityvalue', 'combined', 'fields', 'contemporary', 'networks', 'investigate', 'environmental', 'architecture', 'energysaving', 'saving', 'designmethodologyapproach', 'explain', 'iot', 'efficient', 'interoperability', 'change', 'system', 'improved', 'proposing', 'advancement', 'comfort', 'environment', 'promote', 'etc', 'opportunities']",2020,"[(3, 0.9981925)]"
A new approach to refining land use types: Predicting point-of-interest categories using Weibo check-in data,Zhang X.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi9020124,35,True,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"The information of land use plays an important role in urban planning and optimizing the allocation of resources. However, traditional land use classification is imprecise. For instance, the type of commercial land is highly filled with the categories of shopping, eating, etc. The number of mixed-use lands is increasingly growing nowadays, and these lands sometimes are too mixed to be well investigated by conventional approaches such as remote sensing technology. To address this issue, we used a new social sensing approach to classify land use according to human mobility and activity patterns. Previous studies used other social sensing approaches to predict land use types at the parcel or the area level, whilst fine-grained point-of-interest (POI)-level land use data are likely to more useful in urban planning. To abridge this research gap, we proposed a new social sensing approach dedicated to classifying land use at a finer scale (i.e., POI-level or building level) according to human mobility and activity patterns reflected by location-based social network (LBSN) data. Specifically, we firstly investigated spatial and temporal patterns of human mobility and activity behavior using check-in data from a popular Chinese LBSN named Sina Weibo and subsequently applied those patterns to predicting the category of POI to refine urban land use classification in Guangzhou, China. In this study, we applied three classification methods (i.e., naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forest) to recognize category of a certain POI by spatial and temporal features of human mobility and activity behavior as well as POIs' locational characteristics. Random forest outperformed the other two methods and obtained an overall accuracy of 72.21%. Apart from that, we compared the results of the different rules in filtering check-in samples. The comparison results show that a reasonable rule to select samples is essential for predicting the category of POI. Moreover, the approach proposed in this study can be potentially applied to identifying functions of buildings according to visitors' mobility and activity behavior and buildings' locational characteristics.","['patterns', 'mixed', 'new', 'number', 'social', 'visitors', 'filtering', 'use', 'applied', 'ie', 'human', 'apart', 'well', 'essential', 'conventional', 'abridge', 'machines', 'scale', 'buildings', 'investigated', 'recognize', 'proposed', 'optimizing', 'likely', 'traditional', 'instance', 'resources', 'predict', 'predicting', 'two', 'role', 'temporal', 'subsequently', 'identifying', 'remote', 'refine', 'pois', 'three', 'comparison', 'highly', 'popular', 'increasingly', 'parcel', 'technology', 'specifically', 'category', 'network', 'rule', 'potentially', 'naive', 'lands', 'bayes', 'mixeduse', 'types', 'chinese', 'vector', 'sensing', 'previous', 'classify', 'checkin', 'allocation', 'show', 'finegrained', 'approaches', 'type', 'behavior', 'important', 'sometimes', 'obtained', 'studies', 'growing', 'compared', 'forest', 'weibo', 'whilst', 'gap', 'shopping', 'locational', 'useful', 'samples', 'imprecise', 'random', 'lbsn', 'plays', 'land', 'overall', 'select', 'according', 'eating', 'commercial', 'certain', 'firstly', 'named', 'nowadays', 'sina', 'reflected', 'locationbased', 'area', 'address', 'mobility', 'issue', 'functions', 'poilevel', 'features', 'characteristics', 'dedicated', 'finer', 'building', 'reasonable', 'pointofinterest', 'different', 'outperformed', 'guangzhou', 'support', 'filled', 'accuracy', 'moreover', 'poi', 'classifying', 'activity', 'categories', 'level', 'etc', 'rules', 'classification']",2020,"[(1, 0.99889183)]"

To perform in-depth walkability analysis, one option is to objectively evaluate different aspects of built environment related to walkability. In this study, we proposed a computational framework for walkability measurement using open data. Three major steps of this framework include the web scrapping of publicly available online data, determining varying weights of variables, and generating a synthetic walkability index. The results suggest three major conclusions. First, the proposed framework provides an explicit mechanism for walkability measurement. Second, the synthetic walkability index from this framework is comparable to Walk Score, and it tends to have a slightly higher sensitivity, especially in highly walkable areas in urban core. Third, this framework was effectively applied in a metropolitan area that contains three small cities that together represent a small, old shrinking region, which extends the topical area in the literature. This framework has the potential to quantify walkability in any city, especially cities with a small population where walkability has rarely been studied, or those having no quantification indicator. For such areas, researchers can calculate the synthetic walkability index based on this framework, to assist urban planners, community leaders, health officials, and policymakers in their practices to improve the walking environment of their communities.","['community', 'walking', 'web', 'common', 'applied', 'topical', 'tends', 'conclusions', 'open', 'varying', 'improve', 'publicly', 'literature', 'policymakers', 'inexpensive', 'together', 'scrapping', 'determining', 'walk', 'cities', 'contains', 'proposed', 'weights', 'calculate', 'indicator', 'core', 'suggest', 'leaders', 'second', 'slightly', 'communities', 'population', 'three', 'highly', 'aspects', 'walkability', 'effectively', 'major', 'higher', 'steps', 'variables', 'comparable', 'areas', 'include', 'provides', 'index', 'option', 'type', 'explicit', 'old', 'one', 'related', 'synthetic', 'quantify', 'generating', 'metropolitan', 'health', 'available', 'built', 'planners', 'online', 'third', 'assist', 'sensitivity', 'practices', 'small', 'score', 'quantification', 'city', 'measurement', 'indepth', 'potential', 'area', 'officials', 'walkable', 'computational', 'shrinking', 'physical', 'perform', 'objectively', 'rarely', 'first', 'studied', 'represent', 'region', 'evaluate', 'researchers', 'different', 'extends', 'mechanism', 'environmentfriendly', 'environment', 'activity', 'especially']",2020,"[(0, 0.9484102), (1, 0.050500736)]"

This issue has historically been left to administrative criteria, which can vary significantly across countries and political systems, hindering a comparative analysis across urban systems. However, the wide use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has now allowed the development of new quantitative approaches to unveil how social dynamics relates to urban infrastructure. In fact, ICT provide the potential to portray more accurate descriptions of the urban systems based on the empirical analysis of millions of traces left by urbanites across the city. In this work, we apply computational techniques over a large volume of mobile phone records to define urban boundaries, through the analysis of travel patterns and the trajectory of urban dwellers in conurbations with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Chile. We created and analyzed the network of interconnected places inferred from individual travel trajectories. We then ranked each place using a spectral centrality method. This allowed to identify places of higher concurrency and functional importance for each urban environment. Urban scaling analysis is finally used as a diagnostic tool that allowed to distinguish urban from non-urban spaces. The geographic assessment of our method shows a high congruence with the current and administrative definitions of urban agglomerations in Chile.

Accurate identification of urban hinterlands can help to scientifically evaluate strength and potential of urban development. The field strength model is regarded as an effective way to identify hinterlands, but the revision of friction coefficient has still not reached a consensus. With the application of big data in urban planning, it is possible to improve the field strength model. Toponym co–occurrence data, as a timely data source directly obtained from the Internet, can be used to reflect the spatiotemporal changes in urban connections, and provide an approach to quantifying the friction coefficient for the division of urban hinterlands. In this study, a new approach was developed by integrating toponym co–occurrence and improved field strength model. We considered the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration as a case and identified the urban hinterland of each city. The results showed that the friction coefficient among cities fluctuated within a range of 1.25–2.50, the urban hinterlands were no longer confined to their own administrative divisions, and there was fierce competition with other cities. In particular, the urban hinterland of Guangzhou was 3699 km2 larger than its actual administrative area. In addition, the proposed approach was more reliable in urban hinterland identification compared with the traditional fixed friction coefficient method.

With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas-""the concepts and elements of the smart city"", ""the smart city and the Internet of Things"", and ""the smart city of the future""-through document co-citation analysis. There are four key directions-""research objectives and development-strategy research"", ""technical-support research"", ""data-processing and applied research"", and ""management and applied research""-analyzed using keywords co-occurrence. Finally, the research frontiers are urban-development, sustainable cities, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, integration, undertaken through keyword co-occurrence analysis.","['intelligence', 'management', 'social', 'number', 'bases', 'web', 'use', 'applied', 'cooccurrence', 'method', 'document', 'sciences', 'integration', 'making', 'improve', 'time', 'literature', 'smart', 'things', 'cities', 'finally', 'objectives', 'congestion', 'core', 'noise', 'elements', 'futurethrough', 'dataprocessing', 'including', 'slicing', 'artificial', 'sustainable', 'concepts', 'technicalsupport', 'three', 'problems', 'four', 'mapping', 'vosviewer', 'grows', 'rapidly', 'scientometric', 'created', 'wos', 'strategy', 'collection', 'terms', 'undertaken', 'better', 'index', 'ssci', 'areasthe', 'computing', 'decade', 'digital', 'internet', 'urbandevelopment', 'related', 'technologies', 'frontiers', 'diversity', 'developmentstrategy', 'growing', 'keyword', 'researchanalyzed', 'contexts', 'transportation', 'key', 'directionsresearch', 'urbanization', 'past', 'main', 'citation', 'expanded', 'garbage', 'emerging', 'smartcity', 'difficulty', 'science', 'populations', 'industry', 'topics', 'dynamics', 'distribution', 'city', 'aim', 'comprehensive', 'cloud', 'accelerate', 'help', 'keywords', 'cocitation', 'divided', 'studied', 'life', 'field', 'continues', 'residents', 'quality', 'researchers', 'scie', 'pollution', 'make', 'citespace', 'disposing']",2019,"[(2, 0.9982818)]"
Identification of urban functional regions based on floating car track data and POI data,Yu B.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su11236541,32,True,Lanzhou Jiaotong University,Lanzhou,China,"Alongwith the rapid development of China's economy aswell as the continuing urbanization, the internal spatial and functional structures of citieswithin this country are also gradually changing and restructuring. The study of functional region identification of a city is of great significance to the city's functional cognition, spatial planning, economic development, human livability, and so forth. Backed by the emerging urban Big Data, and taking the traffic community as the smallest research unit, a method is proposed to identify urban functional regions by combining floating car track data with point of interest (POI) data recorded on an electronic map. It provides a new perspective for the study of urban functional region identification. Firstly, the main functional regions of the city studied are identified through clustering analysis according to the passenger's spatial-temporal travel characteristics derived from the floating car data. Secondly, the fine-grained identification of the functional region attributes of the traffic communities is achieved using the label information from POI data. Finally, the AND-OR operation is performed on the recognition results derived by the clustering algorithm and the Delphi method, to obtain the identification of urban functional regions. This approach is verified by applying it to the main urban zone within Chengdu's Third Ring Road. The results show that: (1) There are fewer single functional regions and more mixed functional regions in the main urban zone of Chengdu, and the distribution of the functional regions are roughly concentric centering in the city center. (2) Using the traffic community as a research unit, combined with dynamic human activity trajectory data and static urban interest point data, complex urban functional regions can be effectively identified.","['community', 'mixed', 'new', 'method', 'human', 'alongwith', 'map', 'ring', 'traffic', 'rapid', 'unit', 'chengdus', 'spatialtemporal', 'finally', 'zone', 'proposed', 'clustering', 'changing', 'performed', 'centering', 'combining', 'regions', 'communities', 'track', 'complex', 'forth', 'cognition', 'secondly', 'dynamic', 'citieswithin', 'effectively', 'economic', 'fewer', 'road', 'recorded', 'operation', 'provides', 'achieved', 'andor', 'concentric', 'electronic', 'show', 'perspective', 'chinas', 'finegrained', 'great', 'internal', 'verified', 'chengdu', 'livability', 'roughly', 'trajectory', 'center', 'car', 'attributes', 'urbanization', 'identification', 'main', 'obtain', 'within', 'travel', 'emerging', 'applying', 'label', 'third', 'citys', 'smallest', 'according', 'identified', 'point', 'restructuring', 'distribution', 'city', 'passengers', 'firstly', 'continuing', 'interest', 'taking', 'single', 'combined', 'recognition', 'economy', 'static', 'functional', 'characteristics', 'studied', 'algorithm', 'region', 'identify', 'delphi', 'structures', 'aswell', 'country', 'significance', 'gradually', 'poi', 'activity', 'backed', 'derived', 'floating']",2019,"[(1, 0.9986157)]"
A scholarly backcasting approach to a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future: strategic problem orientation,Bibri S.E.,"City, Territory and Architecture",10.1186/s40410-019-0102-3,30,True,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Sustainable cities have, since the early 1990s, been the leading global paradigm of urban planning and development thanks to the different models of sustainable urban form proposed as new frameworks for redesigning and restructuring urban places to achieve sustainability. Indeed, huge advances in some areas of sustainability knowledge and a multitude of exemplary practical initiatives have been realized, thereby raising the profile of sustainable cities worldwide. The change is still inspiring and the challenge continues to induce scholars and practitioners to enhance existing, and propose new, models. Especially, sustainable urban forms have been problematic, whether in theory or practice, so is yet knowing to what extent progress has been made towards sustainable cities. They are associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges and thus much more needs to be done considering the very fragmented, conflicting picture that arises of change on the ground in the face of the expanding urbanization. This involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, planned, and even integrated so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability. This brings us to the issue of sustainable cities and smart cities being extremely fragmented as landscapes and weakly connected as approaches, despite the proven role and untapped potential of advanced ICT, especially big data technology, for advancing sustainability under what is labeled ‘smart sustainable cities.’ Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, such cities, which depends on how they can be conceptualized. This paper details the two parts of strategic problem orientation by answering the guiding questions for Steps 1 and 2 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the first one. We argue that a deeper understanding of the multi-faceted processes of change or the interplay between social, technological, and scientific solutions is required to achieve more sustainable cities. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability.

60 years of radar remote sensing: Four-stage development,Guo H.,Yaogan Xuebao/Journal of Remote Sensing,10.11834/jrs.20199398,11,True,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing has experienced 60 years of development. It has played an important role in earth observation, especially in the fields of global change, resource exploration, environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, urban planning and planetary exploration. Throughout the development process of SAR remote sensing, it has essentially been a process of continuous exploitation and utilization of microwave and electromagnetic wave resources. According to its observation technology and electromagnetic wave resources utilized, SAR remote sensing has experienced four stages: the single-band and single-polarization SAR stage, the multi-band and multi-polarization SAR stage, the polarization and interferometric SAR stage, and the fourth stage or the new stage marked by the emergence of dual/multi-station or constellation observation, high spatio-temporal resolution and wide swath mapping, and 3-D structure imaging capability. Based on the author's rich research experiences in the field of SAR remote sensing, this paper first briefly summarizes and reviews the characteristics of various stages and the landmark technologies, as well as the typical applications of SAR remote sensing in agriculture, forestry, geology and disaster application fields. Secondly, from the viewpoint of observation technology, data processing and application, the paper expounds the development trend of SAR remote sensing in the new stage, as well as the prospect of combining SAR remote sensing with artificial intelligence and big data techniques.

The rise of data science, both in industry and academia, has put new pressures on urban research, but has also allowed for new analytical possibilities. Because of the rapid growth and change in the field, terminology in urban analytics can be vague and unclear. This paper, an abridged synthesis of a panel discussion among scholars in Urban Data Science held at the 2019 American Association of Geographers Conference in Washington, D.C., outlines one discussion seeking a better sense of the conceptual, terminological, social, and ethical challenges faced by researchers in this emergent field. The panel outlines the difficulties of defining what is or is not urban data science, finding that good urban data science must have an expansive role in a successful discipline of “city science.” It suggests that “data science” has value as a “signaling” term in industrial or popular science applications, but which may not necessarily be well-understood within purely academic circles. The panel also discusses the normative value of doing urban data science, linking successful practice back to urban life.

Mismatch of morphological and functional polycentricity in Chinese cities: An evidence from land development and functional linkage,Yue W.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104176,53,False,Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"The polycentric urban structure is regarded to be more rational than the monocentric structure in recent urban studies. However, challenges have emerged in the implementation of the polycentric strategy accompanying with rapid urbanization in developing countries. The concept of polycentricity need to be re-examined in the developing context and the performance of polycentric urban development need to be further quantitatively assessed. This paper attempted to fill the research gaps and established a general framework for evaluating intra-urban polycentricity based on China's context. The measurement of morphological and functional polycentricity as well as the relationship between them were explored based on urban big data. Using the case of Shanghai, it was found that the functional subcenters identified by mobile phone communication data are not always consistent with the morphological subcenters recognized through land development. The development of functional polycentricity (e.g., urban functional linkages) generally lags behind that of morphological advancement (e.g., physical urban expansion). Both socioeconomic and planning forces have significantly shaped the polycentric pattern of Shanghai.

Topic modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities,Lai Y.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101383,29,False,NYU Tandon School of Engineering,New York,United States,"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts.

Functional urban land use recognition integrating multi-source geospatial data and cross-correlations,Zhang Y.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101374,92,False,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"The significance of urban function recognition has stimulated the need for multi-source geospatial data fusion, especially the fusion between remote sensing images and spatiotemporal big data. In previous studies, the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data has often been ignored in the description of one object, which would influence the performance of data fusion. Therefore, this study introduces the cross-correlations mechanism to achieve the natural correspondence by taking remote sensing images, point of interest (POI), and real-time social media users as an example. It proposes a new cross-correlations based functional urban land use (CC-FLU) model to infer urban functions. The presented model extracts physical and human semantic features from multi-source geospatial data, then maps them to their common subspaces to obtain their cross-correlations respectively. These semantic features and their cross-correlations are integrated together to classify urban functions. An experiment in Shenzhen, China was implemented to evaluate the performance of the presented model at a fine scale. The results show that the proposed CC-FLU model achieved a better performance than previous methods, yielding OA and Kappa values of 0.851 and 0.812, respectively. The results of the presented approach outperform those of methods using one single source geospatial data. The results demonstrate that the skilled information of each type of geospatial data is fully melted into the data fusion model, and simultaneously achieves the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data. Moreover, this study resolves the possible disadvantages of models using one single source data and fusion methods by sequentially concatenating multi-source features.

Biking islands in cities: An analysis combining bike trajectory and percolation theory,Zhang Y.,Journal of Transport Geography,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.102497,26,False,University College London,London,United Kingdom,"Bike trajectories generated by the dockless bike-sharing service provides a great opportunity to explore users' travel behavior within the shared mobility transportation ecosystem. This paper proposes a new concept, namely biking islands, defined as geographical areas of interest with a high concentration of bike usage. Leveraging high-resolution trajectory data, biking islands are identified via percolation theory because of its suitability in describing the formation of clusters and critical road segments that have significant influence on biking behavior in an urban context. We showcase our methodology using the bike trajectory dataset provided by a market-leading company and use Shanghai, China as the study area. Results reveal a hierarchical structure of biking islands. With the increase of threshold, the biking islands start to shrink and split into various smaller ones. Larger biking islands are usually located in the central urban area of Shanghai and the Huangpu River acts as a natural barrier that impedes biking continuity across the region. Besides, the formation of biking islands is highly influenced by the surrounding land uses. The proposed concept and methods are not only helpful to understand travel behavior of cyclists and urban structures used for cycling, but also has the potential to support relevant urban and transportation planning, such as identifying designated non-motorized areas for cycling and biking facilities and pinpointing critical road segments that can improve the cycling efficiency of the entire network.

The Nature of Neighborhoods: Using Big Data to Rethink the Geographies of Atlanta’s Neighborhood Planning Unit System,Shelton T.,Annals of the American Association of Geographers,10.1080/24694452.2019.1571895,33,False,Mississippi State University,Mississippi State,United States,"Neighborhoods have long held a central place in the analysis and planning of urban spaces. Despite this centrality, the exact definition of a neighborhood, as well as how and where to draw its boundaries, has remained unclear. Although these questions have generated significant academic debate, they have arguably little effect on people’s everyday lives or decision-making processes. Atlanta, Georgia, represents a different case, however, because of the city’s system of neighborhood planning units (NPUs), which has shaped the city’s planning and political processes since the mid-1970s. Despite significant changes within the city’s intraurban geography since the 1970s, however, the geography of the NPU system has remained largely unchanged. As such, this article attempts to harness the potentials of big data to rethink the nature and geographies of Atlanta’s neighborhoods. Drawing on archival documents, historic maps of the city’s neighborhoods, and new sources of big data, this article explores the evolution of Atlanta’s neighborhoods from the 1960s up to the present day.

We build on Bratton’s position by closely examining twenty-first century histories and anthropologies related to the internet, privacy, and the dominance of big data. Our principal concern is with the transformation of personal and environmental data into an economic resource. Seen through that particular lens, we argue that Toronto’s smart city has internalized relations of colonization whereby the economic objectives of a multinational technology company take on new configurations at a local level of human (and non-human) information extraction—thereby restructuring not only public land, but also everyday life into a zone of unmitigated consumption.","['resource', 'disruption', 'new', 'examining', 'seen', 'public', 'internet', 'way', 'argue', 'privacy', 'technological', 'principal', 'human', 'related', 'waterfront', 'build', 'technology', 'consumption', 'stack', 'environmental', 'acknowledging', 'whereby', 'internalized', 'specifically', 'lens', 'local', 'everyday', 'economic', 'configurations', 'understand', 'relations', 'life', 'unmitigated', 'concern', 'torontos', 'toronto', 'personal', 'smart', 'disciplinary', 'closely', 'nonhuman', 'cities', 'zone', 'twentyfirst', 'objectives', 'generally', 'anthropologies', 'dominance', 'multinational', 'land', 'company', 'site', 'take', 'introduces', 'brattons', 'particular', 'transformation', 'level', 'century', 'position', 'colonization', 'extractionthereby', 'histories', 'restructuring', 'city']",2019,"[(2, 0.997227)]"

In this work HDR satellite image dataset used for pre-processing purpose. Normally the sky's dynamic range is as large as 106:1, while the LDR (Low Dynamic Range) display has a dynamic range of 103:1. Therefore, HDR satellite image needs to compress this dynamic range to get LDR image. TMO (Tone Mapping Operator) is used for excellent visualization purposes to solve this issue and has served excellent image quality. Satellite captured images are very large in size, with ordinary display facing difficulties in viewing and understanding the information available in an image. Therefore, the whole image needs to be divided into tiny components with big data, so it helps to comprehend and visualize. To overcome this problem segmentation method is to be used. There are various image segmentation methods like Edge based, Clustering based, watershed based, etc. In this work compared clustering based image segmentation like K-means clustering, Mean shift clustering and SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) by extracting various features like processing time, Mean, Entropy, variance, etc, .

Through technical and humanistic collaboration, the project aims to create models that allow children and young people to participate in overcoming future challenges in cities by becoming active and contributing participants in research and development efforts. Further, the project contributes knowledge about community-driven game tools, user-driven big data and the Internet of Things and their connection with intelligent and socially responsible urban development. The project is conducted in cooperation with the city of Copenhagen, local schools and Aalborg University. Community Drive involves students, aged 10–13, attending schools in deprived neighbourhoods near Aalborg University Copenhagen in southern Copenhagen. This area is characterised by a high rate of unemployment, low income and residents with little or no education. As a result, resources have been allocated for reconditioning the subsidised housing in this area. In this paper, we discuss the ways in which Community Drive, initiated in May 2018, is based on the results of pilot projects conducted from 2014 to 2017. Overall, these studies showed that tasking students with changing their living conditions by redesigning their neighbourhoods is a strong motivational factor. During the redesign process, students were able to construct game-based models of various residents’ needs and argue for redesigns based on their knowledge about the area and the ability of certain designs to fulfil the needs of various groups of residents living in the area.

Timisoara is the second city in Romania and manages over 60% of the development and pollution of Timis County. The analysis of large volumes of data provided by local sensors and databases requires big data analytics. In this research, for the first time, we simultaneously developed two parallel scenario-based decision-making support models to assess a CO2 sequestration index. The model is based on a tree inventory for traffic area and car flow using Roegenian processes with borders. The first scenario (dt1) analyzes the real O2-pollution car flows for process streets as receivers of pollution. The second scenario (dt2) analyzes O2-pollution flows for the same streets from the perspective of streets that garage the cars. We modeled the parallel integration of actual O2 production and pollution flows for 160 main streets that account for over 50% of the urban mileage of Timisoara city. The carbon sequestration indexes of the streets are in the range of 0.0000043-0.437 (dt1) and 0.0000092-11.78 (dt2).

Unveiling the inter-relations between the urban streets network and its dynamic traffic flows: Planning implication,Serok N.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/2399808319837982,17,False,Tel Aviv University,Tel Aviv-Yafo,Israel,"Traffic flows have always been a major element affecting the nature of urban streets. Traffic flows influence the location of businesses, residences, and the development of real estate, land values, and built-density. In this study, we suggest that revealing the relations between the static street network and dynamic traffic flows may provide meaningful and useful insights that could be applied in planning processes. Thus, the objective of this work is to unveil the inter-relations between the dynamics of traffic flows and urban street networks in different areas of a city and between cities. We use network percolation analysis (i.e., removal of links with a speed value lower than a pre-defined threshold) to develop an innovative method to identify functional spatio-temporal street clusters that represent fluent traffic flow. We employed our method on two data sets of London and Tel Aviv centers and analyzed the dynamics of these clusters, based on their size (in terms of street length) and their spatial stability over time. Our findings revealed both the differences between the two cities as well as differences and similarities between different areas within each city. Thus, our method can be used to develop new, real-time, decision-making tools for urban and transportation planners. Today, new technologies provide big data on urban traffic flow, which can be used in developing new, adaptive tools for planning. However, urban and transportation planning are currently being challenged by real-time navigation apps that aim to find the fastest routes for their users. To be able to intervene and affect urban life quality, planners should adopt new tools that are based on real-time, short-term approaches.

Taking the Baishazhou area of Wuhan, a local area of a mega city in China, as a case study, we simulated the travel behaviors of commuters: the spatial context of the model is set up using the existing urban road network and by dividing the area into space units. Then, using the mobile phone call detail records of a month, statistics of residents’ travel during the four time slots in working day mornings are acquired and then used to generate the Origin-Destination matrix of travels at different time slots, and the data are imported into the model for simulation. Under the preset rules of congestion, the agent-based model can effectively simulate the traffic conditions of each traffic intersection, and can induce backward the causes of traffic congestion using the simulation results and the Origin-Destination matrix.

A Bayesian approach to mapping the uncertainties of global urban lands,Ouyang Z.,Landscape and Urban Planning,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.016,4,False,Michigan State University,East Lansing,United States,"Global distribution of urban lands is one of the essential pieces of information necessary for urban planning. However, large disagreement exists among different products and the uncertainty remains difficult to quantify. We applied a Bayesian approach to map the uncertainties of global urban lands. We demonstrated the approach by producing a hybrid global urban land map that synthesized five different urban land maps in ca. 2000 at 1-km resolution. The resulting hybrid map is a posterior probability map with pixel values suggesting the probability of being urban land, which is validated by 30-m higher resolution references. We also quantified the minimum and maximum urban areas in 2000 for each country/continent based on subjective probability thresholds (i.e., 0.9 and 0.1)on our hybrid urban map. Globally, we estimated that the urban land area was between 377,000 and 533,000 km2 in 2000. The credible interval of minimum/maximum urban area can help guide future studies in estimating urban areas. In addition to providing uncertainty information, the hybrid map also achieves higher accuracy than individual maps when it is converted into a binary urban/non-urban map using a probability threshold of 0.5. This new method has the ability to further integrate discrete site/location-based data, local, regional, and global urban land maps. As more data is sequentially integrated, the accuracy is expected to improve.

A Big Data approach based on the lexica used on social media was proposed to develop well-being indicators. Using the 2016 data of Weibo (i.e. the Chinese version of Twitter), this study finds that the relationship between residents’ well-being and GDP per capita and the relationship between residents’ well-being and population size both form inverted U-shaped curves. Specifically, for poor cities, levels of well-being increase as GDP per capita increases. But after peaking at around the median GDP per capita point, levels of well-being drop as the city’s economy continues to increase. Similarly, levels of well-being increase with population size for small cities, but decrease for those cities whose population sizes rank in the top quarter.

Achieving neuroplasticity in artificial neural networks through smart cities,Allam Z.,Smart Cities,10.3390/smartcities2020009,34,True,Curtin University,Perth,Australia,"Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander’s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander’s concept of “wholeness” through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.","['intelligence', 'ann', 'models', 'patterns', 'encourages', 'management', 'promoted', 'use', 'unidimensional', 'nature', 'similitude', 'theoretical', 'theorists', 'components', 'various', 'selflearning', 'smart', 'things', 'cities', 'encouraging', 'richer', 'coherence', 'neuroplasticity', 'takes', 'component', 'artificial', 'interactions', 'properties', 'complex', 'christopher', 'inspiration', 'accentuating', 'neural', 'processes', 'alexanders', 'interactivity', 'singular', 'toward', 'functioning', 'render', 'emergence', 'inclusive', 'rendered', 'engineers', 'contrasting', 'fashion', 'perspective', 'connection', 'internet', 'complexity', 'one', 'looking', 'anns', 'order', 'whereby', 'neurological', 'brain', 'sequence', 'wholeness', 'planners', 'learning', 'proposes', 'dwells', 'aimed', 'emerging', 'done', 'unique', 'particular', 'machine', 'overlapping', 'context', 'plastic', 'interest', 'contemporary', 'networks', 'functions', 'creating', 'concept', 'iot', 'multidimensional', 'support', 'creation', 'intricate', 'system', 'stronger', 'caters', 'working', 'boasts', 'interdisciplinary', 'thereby']",2019,"[(2, 0.9979957)]"

Residents in central urban areas are more likely than others to pursue activity resilience, due to agglomeration, whereas residents in towns outside central urban areas are not greatly affected by urban life resilience due to the low level of population agglomeration. (3) The agglomeration characteristics of coupling coordination level are not significant as the distribution of low-level coupling coordination areas is mixed, with only the coupling coordination level of peripheral towns being slightly high.

Using big GPS trajectory data analytics for vehicle miles traveled estimation,Fan J.,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.019,37,False,"University of Maryland, College Park",College Park,United States,"As location-sensing devices and apps become more prevalent, the scale and availability of big GPS trajectory data are also rapidly expanding. Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland's road network.

Does polycentric and compact development alleviate urban traffic congestion?

Drawing upon a direct and big-data-based measure of congestion and gridded (1 km × 1 km) population data of 98 Chinese cities, this study investigates how polycentricity and compactness may affect congestion in these cities. The degrees of polycentricity and compactness are measured through fine-grained identification of population centers. All else being equal, the empirical results show that congestion is positively associated with the degree of compactness but negatively associated with that of polycentricity. However, increasing the degree of polycentricity by developing more than four population centers may also lead to more congestion. Furthermore, the negative impact of polycentricity on congestion becomes weaker with the increase in a city's population and even turns positive for large cities with more than six million inhabitants within urban districts.

Application of Big Data and Analytic Network Process for the Adaptive Reuse Strategies of School Land,Huang J.Y.,Social Indicators Research,10.1007/s11205-018-1951-y,17,False,National Taipei University,Taipei,Taiwan,"Most recent discussion of the adaptive reuse of school land has focused almost exclusively on repurposing or redeploying vacant school space rather than comprehensively re-planning and constructing the entire school land for the overall needs of society and urban development. The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life.

Spatial analysis using temporal point clouds in advanced GIS: Methods for ground elevation extraction in slant areas and building classifications,Shirowzhan S.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi8030120,35,True,UNSW Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"Deriving 3D urban development patterns is necessary for urban planners to control the future directions of 3D urban growth considering the availability of infrastructure or being prepared for fundamental infrastructure. Urban metrics have been used so far for quantification of landscape and land-use change. However, these studies focus on the horizontal development of urban form. Therefore, questions remain about 3D growth patterns. Both 3D data and appropriate 3D metrics are fundamentally required for vertical development pattern extraction. Airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) as an advanced remote-sensing technology provides 3D data required for such studies. Processing of airborne lidar to extract buildings’ heights above a footprint is a major task and current automatic algorithms fail to extract such information on vast urban areas especially in hilly sites. This research focuses on proposing new methods of extraction of ground points in hilly urban areas using autocorrelation-based algorithms. The ground points then would be used for digital elevation model generation and elimination of ground elevation from classified buildings points elevation. Technical novelties in our experimentation lie in choosing a different window direction and also contour lines for the slant area, and applying moving windows and iterating non-ground extraction. The results are validated through calculation of skewness and kurtosis values. The results show that changing the shape of windows and their direction to be narrow long squares parallel to the ground contour lines, respectively, improves the results of classification in slant areas. Four parameters, namely window size, window shape, window direction and cell size are empirically chosen in order to improve initial digital elevation model (DEM) creation, enhancement of the initial DEM, classification of non-ground points and final creation of a normalised digital surface model (NDSM). The results of these enhanced algorithms are robust for generating reliable DEMs and separation of ground and non-ground points in slant urban scenes as evidenced by the results of skewness and kurtosis.

(2) The single functional area is the most common area type in the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. The largest proportion of all areas is allocated to traditional manufacturing industry functional areas, followed by high-tech enterprises, catering and entertainment, real estate, and education and health care, in descending order. The smallest proportion is allocated to finance and insurance functional areas. (3) The current layout of the functional areas in the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone conforms to the overall requirements and planning objectives of the central and local government. The layout and agglomeration of different blocks within the economic development zone are consistent with local industry's target orientation and development history.","['history', 'new', 'case', 'common', 'method', 'technological', 'analyze', 'distinguish', 'education', 'map', 'cities', 'zone', 'objectives', 'traditional', 'descending', 'following', 'largest', 'grid', 'takes', 'estate', 'hightech', 'complex', 'implement', 'manufacturing', 'technology', 'effectively', 'ratio', 'provide', 'economic', 'central', 'autonavi', 'entertainment', 'shows', 'allocated', 'areas', 'amap', 'provides', 'index', 'types', 'industrys', 'layout', 'catering', 'type', 'internet', 'orientation', 'order', 'care', 'local', 'enterprises', 'health', 'identification', 'function', 'main', 'within', 'proposes', 'plans', 'detailed', 'conforms', 'agglomeration', 'insurance', 'finance', 'smallest', 'overall', 'followed', 'industry', 'point', 'government', 'distribution', 'frequency', 'zones', 'blocks', 'interest', 'area', 'single', 'functions', 'target', 'recognition', 'density', 'functional', 'characteristics', 'basic', 'consistent', 'real', 'requirements', 'different', 'guangzhou', 'proportion', 'current', 'poi', 'units']",2019,"[(1, 0.99846244)]"
Measuring spatio-temporal accessibility to emergency medical services through big GPS data,Xia T.,Health and Place,10.1016/j.healthplace.2019.01.012,82,True,The University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"Medical accessibility is an important indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of public health services. However, the previous medical accessibility studies mainly focus on spatial accessibility without considering temporal variation in population distribution which is significant for evaluating access to emergency medical service (EMS). This paper proposes a model of spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS called ST-E2SFCA based on adapting the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. We apply our method to the greater Tokyo area for a large volume of GPS dataset with millions of users and compare the accessibility difference over space and time. To evaluate our model, we also analyze the distinction of our model over different weight sets and compare the performance of ST-E2SFCA with the traditional E2SFCA. The result shows that our method can illustrate the temporal difference and is suitable for measuring the spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS, thus can guide the hospital location selection and urban planning.","['sets', 'location', 'difference', 'large', 'emergency', 'public', 'population', 'important', 'called', 'method', 'area', 'illustrate', 'result', 'selection', 'hospital', 'analyze', 'significant', 'mainly', 'gps', 'apply', 'twostep', 'studies', 'dataset', 'considering', 'users', 'time', 'volume', 'evaluating', 'without', 'ems', 'effectiveness', 'weight', 'focus', 'health', 'spatiotemporal', 'compare', 'enhanced', 'catchment', 'evaluate', 'distinction', 'accessibility', 'different', 'proposes', 'shows', 'space', 'adapting', 'tokyo', 'service', 'traditional', 'suitable', 'thus', 'indicator', 'access', 'guide', 'services', 'greater', 'measuring', 'variation', 'temporal', 'medical', 'previous', 'millions', 'floating', 'distribution']",2019,"[(1, 0.9978402)]"
"Bidirectional urban flows in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas and their macro and micro impacts on urban growth: A case study of the Yangtze River middle reaches megalopolis, China",Xia C.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.12.007,73,False,The University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"Bidirectional urban flows of materials, technologies and information are becoming more frequent, and cities are closely connected socially, economically and technologically. Thus, an open, mobile and polycentric urban network has gradually formed. However, most of the recent studies on urban landscape dynamics regarded each city as a single entity and ignored intercity relatedness. In this study, we took as an example the Yangtze River middle reaches megalopolis (YRMRM), which is one of the rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas in China. We pose two research questions: (1) Do intercity factors impact the expansion of urban land at a macro level? (2) Do intercity factors impact the spatial patterns of urban growth at a micro level? We used geospatial big data to measure urban relatedness and spatial interaction among city groups from a macro perspective. Then, a spatially explicit approach based on a data field model was adopted to quantify the micro urban spatial interaction inside each city. The pattern of spatial interaction and its impacts on urban growth were also analysed. The results showed that the three city sub-groups developed well, with Wuhan, Nanchang and Changsha being the dominant cores. However, the macro intercity relatedness in the YRMRM has not broken the shackles of the geographical boundaries of the provinces. A highly connected polycentric urban network system has not been formed to date. Our empirical results indicated that intercity factors were the main drivers of both macro and micro urban growth dynamics in the YRMRM from 2005 to 2015. This finding suggests that population and information flows had strong effects on the promotion of urbanization in the YRMRM during this period. Thus, we argued that urban bidirectional flows should be a vital consideration in future urban spatial planning and regional development strategies.","['adopted', 'patterns', 'developed', 'ignored', 'boundaries', 'open', 'questions', 'well', 'entity', 'geographical', 'frequent', 'river', 'suggests', 'closely', 'cities', 'flows', 'urbanizing', 'recent', 'pose', 'spatially', 'two', 'took', 'cores', 'geospatial', 'population', 'three', 'highly', 'finding', 'dominant', 'provinces', 'subgroups', 'becoming', 'megalopolis', 'yrmrm', 'inside', 'network', 'middle', 'rapidly', 'showed', 'nanchang', 'socially', 'measure', 'empirical', 'relatedness', 'economically', 'areas', 'shackles', 'indicated', 'strong', 'vital', 'expansion', 'interaction', 'perspective', 'growth', 'analysed', 'explicit', 'one', 'technologies', 'studies', 'yangtze', 'wuhan', 'technologically', 'quantify', 'strategies', 'metropolitan', 'factors', 'micro', 'drivers', 'urbanization', 'polycentric', 'regarded', 'materials', 'main', 'land', 'reaches', 'landscape', 'argued', 'effects', 'dynamics', 'bidirectional', 'changsha', 'date', 'city', 'groups', 'promotion', 'formed', 'mobile', 'impacts', 'broken', 'single', 'example', 'connected', 'intercity', 'macro', 'field', 'pattern', 'period', 'consideration', 'future', 'thus', 'gradually', 'system', 'among', 'level', 'regional']",2019,"[(1, 0.9986813)]"

By using several sources of geographical ‘big data’ an analysis framework was structured to measure the urban landscape based on three aspects: city plan, pattern of building form, and urban land use. An association rule analysis was used to explore the relationship between land rent and the urban landscape, and the results indicate that the urban landscape differs across urban areas. The blocks classified as being located in main centers were associated with more convenient public transportation, denser road networks, more vertical street space, more diverse block patterns, more flexible architecture arrangements, mixed uses, high density, and more services. By contrast, non-center areas usually comprised blocks that were larger, tabular, single-purpose, and more regular. Non-center areas often cannot provide high-quality public goods, and they contain scattered large industrial enterprises. The urban landscapes of sub-center blocks fell in between these two urban areas.

Beyond Word2vec: An approach for urban functional region extraction and identification by combining Place2vec and POIs,Zhai W.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.11.008,176,False,University of Florida,Gainesville,United States,"The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter, tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

Our results show that these urban design indicators have a significant and positive relationship with levels of economic vitality for cities at every administrative level. The results contribute to a holistic understanding of how to improve economic vitality in cities across China at a detailed level, particularly at a time when China’s economic growth will depend largely on growth of the service sector in urban areas.

Human activity features extracted from big data have been used for land use classification, and fusing different features can help improve the classification. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate multiple human activity features for land use classification. Features were fused by constructing a membership matrix reflecting the fuzzy relationship between features and land use types using the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method. The classification results were obtained by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, which regards the membership matrix as the fuzzy evaluation matrix. This framework was applied to a case study using taxi trajectory data from Nanjing, and the outflow, inflow, net flow and net flow ratio features were extracted.

Extraction and monitoring approach of dynamic urban commercial area using check-in data from Weibo,Hu Q.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2018.11.039,34,False,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"Urban hot spot detection and commercial area analysis for city economic planning and dynamic urban planning is of vital importance. However, it is difficult to obtain a more accurate commercial area boundary in the past. Check-in data obtained by a social networking service (SNS) and/or a location-based service (LBS) is a type of crowd-sourced geographic data that can reveal mass daily life activities, which provides a new big data source for urban hot spot detection and commercial area analysis. In this paper, a dynamic urban commercial area extraction and monitoring approach is proposed using SINA Weibo (a social network) check-in data. First, a check-in data pre-process model is proposed to simplify the amount of check-in data and improve the efficiency of cluster analysis. The spatial autocorrelation validation is implemented to validate the significant patterns of the spatial clustering of check-in data. Then, an exploratory spatial analysis and hot spot clustering method based on check-in data is proposed to detect urban hot spots and extract commercial areas using a geographic distribution metric with urban commercial hot spots. Second, the hot spot cluster analysis results are taken to determine the center of the commercial area and calculate the distribution of an ellipse, which is adopted to obtain the rough boundary of the commercial area. A planar Delaunay iterative triangulation algorithm is presented to determine the exact boundary of the commercial area. Then, the time sequence extraction result of the commercial area is presented to analyze the evolutionary trend in the city business space. Finally, the Weibo check-in data from 2012 to 2014 of Wuhan city are taken as an example dataset for the commercial area extraction and detection with the proposed approach. The results show that the method can accurately determine the boundary of and changes within the commercial area in Wuhan city.

In the second part, we discuss how the design process of APIs defines conventions of data exchanges that also reflect negotiations between API producers and API consumers about affordances and mental models of the underlying computer systems involved. In the third part, we present recent urban data innovation initiatives, especially CitySDK and OrganiCity, to underline the centrality of API design and governance for new kinds of civic and commercial services developed within and for cities. By bridging the fields of criticism, design, and implementation, we argue that City APIs as elements of infrastructures reveal how urban renewal processes become crucial sites of socio-political contestation between data science, technological development, urban management, and civic participation.","['models', 'become', 'management', 'developed', 'new', 'social', 'systems', 'underline', 'contestation', 'web', 'consumers', 'technological', 'exchanges', 'allow', 'infrastructures', 'negotiations', 'informatics', 'evaluating', 'bridging', 'perspectives', 'smart', 'cities', 'defines', 'present', 'recent', 'second', 'kinds', 'elements', 'role', 'weave', 'architectures', 'sociopolitical', 'grounded', 'communities', 'informed', 'initiatives', 'seams', 'three', 'part', 'dynamic', 'criticism', 'overlooked', 'processes', 'reflect', 'producers', 'conceptualization', 'computer', 'implementation', 'underlying', 'citysdk', 'provides', 'organicity', 'addresses', 'apis', 'sites', 'debates', 'interfaces', 'technically', 'criticisms', 'conventions', 'fabric', 'built', 'function', 'established', 'proprietary', 'affordances', 'media', 'within', 'api', 'discuss', 'centrality', 'renewal', 'third', 'programming', 'science', 'commercial', 'crucial', 'mental', 'critically', 'context', 'city', 'governance', 'term', 'review', 'argue', 'fields', 'involved', 'static', 'innovation', 'first', 'top', 'current', 'integrating', 'sources', 'participation', 'contributing', 'services', 'reveal', 'civic', 'often', 'especially']",2019,"[(3, 0.9982634)]"

The travel patterns of users that take advantage of smart devices to ride a shared-bicycle in two large cities (Chicago and Budapest) have been investigated, with analysis of approximately two million transaction data records associated with bike trips made over a three-month period in each location. Several aspects of user travel behavior—such as day and time of travel, frequency of usage, duration of usage, seasonal and peak/off-peak variations, major origin/destinations—have been included in this analysis. The results show that in both cities the bike-sharing option is a male-dominated alternative, particularly welcomed by younger groups, with the largest share of trips occurring in the afternoon peak.

"Day-to-day variation in excess commuting: An exploratory study of Brisbane, Australia",Zhou J.,Journal of Transport Geography,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.11.014,29,False,The University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"Commuting patterns where most if not all ‘trips are optimised relative to a given distribution of jobs and housing can result in personal and socio-economic benefits. Excess commuting indicators provide useful information for academics and policy analysts to evaluate how the actual commuting pattern deviates from an optimal pattern where commuting costs are minimised. While actual commuting patterns vary from day-to-day, academic researchers have yet to quantify the temporal variation in these indicators over short time periods. This may be due to the lack of available longitudinal data as input for excess commuting indicators. This study shows that new, open and/or big data (NOBD) (e.g. smartcard data) can be exploited to serve as the input for such analysis. In this regard, our study uses half a year's worth of smartcard data from Brisbane, Australia to first derive/aggregate origins and destinations by small areas of the probable commuting trips by transit on all 122 weekdays over the study period. The study quantifies the day-to-day variation in excess commuting indicators for these trips and finds that excess commuting indicators vary considerably from one day to the next. Nevertheless, daily variations occur within a relatively consistent range which can be planned for.

A Modeling Framework for Individual-Based Urban Mobility Based on Data Fusion,Xie J.,International Conference on Geoinformatics,10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8557098,3,False,Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology,Shenzhen,China,"Modeling individual-based urban mobility plays an important role in traffic management, urban planning, public health, public safety and many other fields. Compared with census and travel survey data, which are costly in collection and slow in update, the emergence of massively and automatically generated individual trajectory data, such as mobile phone tracking data and transit smart card data, offers new datasets to develop individual mobility models. However, these new types of human trajectory data suffer some inherent limitations for many research and application domains. First, these large-scale trajectory data often have certain types of sampling biases in the representation of entire population. For example, mobile phone data do not likely cover children and have little coverage in elder people. However, this portion of population is important in some studies, such as household-based travel demand modeling and epidemic modeling. Second, these large-scale individual trajectory data do not often come with individual sociodemographic attributes due to privacy or technical issues. Sociodemographic attributes however are critical in many studies such as household-based travel demand modeling, sociology studies, and epidemic modeling. Therefore, this study proposes a generalizable modeling framework for individual-based urban mobility with entire population and sociodemographic details, through integrating different types of data sources. To demonstrate the proposed modeling framework, we select several typical data sources, design a set of data fusion algorithms, and simulate the daily activities and trips of the entire population in Shenzhen, China. The simulation results show that the proposed data fusion approach can effectively help with sampling bias issues and reasonably fill up sociodemographic details for the large-scale trajectory data. The proposed individual-based urban mobility model can be useful in many studies that require inputting entire population with sociodemographic attributes. This study also gives an example of addressing an important topic in the 'big data' era, that is to integrate the so called 'big data' and traditional data in urban studies.","['models', 'management', 'new', 'several', 'sociodemographic', 'privacy', 'require', 'human', 'set', 'generalizable', 'sociology', 'therefore', 'traffic', 'algorithms', 'smart', 'entire', 'inputting', 'sampling', 'datasets', 'costly', 'proposed', 'likely', 'traditional', 'simulate', 'integrate', 'reasonably', 'second', 'role', 'elder', 'bias', 'fusion', 'householdbased', 'automatically', 'modeling', 'population', 'portion', 'demand', 'details', 'individualbased', 'effectively', 'due', 'limitations', 'suffer', 'collection', 'emergence', 'types', 'trips', 'simulation', 'show', 'largescale', 'come', 'generated', 'typical', 'public', 'important', 'called', 'card', 'little', 'studies', 'compared', 'trajectory', 'survey', 'coverage', 'health', 'attributes', 'demonstrate', 'useful', 'proposes', 'travel', 'era', 'children', 'massively', 'people', 'plays', 'activities', 'select', 'shenzhen', 'representation', 'offers', 'tracking', 'cover', 'develop', 'certain', 'daily', 'individual', 'epidemic', 'technical', 'slow', 'mobile', 'phone', 'help', 'mobility', 'fields', 'example', 'domains', 'issues', 'inherent', 'critical', 'first', 'gives', 'addressing', 'update', 'different', 'integrating', 'sources', 'topic', 'biases', 'fill', 'safety', 'often', 'transit', 'many', 'census']",2018,"[(1, 0.9987745)]"

How does polycentric urban form affect urban commuting? Quantitative measurement using geographical big data of 100 cities in China,Li X.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su10124566,25,True,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,China,"The relationship between polycentric urban form and urban commuting has been widely debated in Western academic circles. However, qualitative and quantitative studies have not reached a unified conclusion. The evolution of urban form in China is remarkably different from that of developed Western countries. Many Chinese cities have begun using polycentric structures as their future development strategies. This study quantitatively measures whether polycentric urban form can improve commuting efficiency in China by using traditional statistics and emerging geographic big data. We use the polycentric index (PI) as the dependent variable and the congestion delay index (CDI) and mean traffic speed (MTS) as the main independent variables. Control variables include urban morphological space compactness (CT), number of private cars per thousand people (PC), number of buses per thousand (PB), urban road area per capita (PUA) and urban population density (PD). Regression models are employed to detect the relationships among the variables. The main research conclusions are as follows: (1) A high degree of PI results in low CDI and fast MTS; (2) a compact spatial form increases the impact of polycentricity on commuting efficiency; (3) maturity road infrastructure is an important measure to promote urban commuting under a polycentric urban form; and (4) the order of effect magnitude of polycentricity on MTS is PD > PC > CT > PUA > PB; on CDI, PD > PC > PB > CT > PUA. The results can be used in examining whether the current polycentric urban pattern planning in China's cities can effectively improve commuting efficiency.

Urban sustainable transportation planning strategies for livable City's quality of life,Wey W.M.,Habitat International,10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.10.002,80,False,National Taipei University,Taipei,Taiwan,"Urban planning and its relevant transportation deploying have a particularly profound influence on the sustainability and livability of a city, and which also be crucial to the quality of life to urban residents at the same time. It was also suggested that the conception of livability should be extended to embrace the concerns associated with the sustainability. However, planning frameworks or assessment patterns that address the dynamics of urban planning and demand for transportation deploying are relatively rare; there also few public policies in related research fields have discussed the effects of the changes in various assessment indicators over time. Furthermore, following the rising advancements in social communication and computer technologies in modern society, the data collection, storage, and processing capabilities of people have improved substantially. And, the emergence of big data or extendible open data facilitates analysis and prediction availability, and enabled people to find immediate solutions to numerous dilemmas encountered. Therefore, based on the aforementioned intention, treating the city as a dynamic process with the trying of introducing the big data or extendible open data for facilitating urban sustainability and livability is undoubtedly worth to explore in further. The present study intends to initially examine the application of big data in sustainable and livable transportation strategies in Taipei City, Taiwan. Firstly, we investigate previous research on transportation sustainability in various countries to generalize our preliminary list of transportation sustainability indices that satisfy the principles of livable cities. And, key indices were then selected through the Fuzzy Delphi Method by administering a questionnaire to six experts from industrial, governmental, and academic sectors respectively. The research results were applied to develop decision-making strategies for responding to the environmental dynamics of Taipei City's transportation infrastructure system by using the analytic network process combined with a data-mining technique. Thus, big data pertaining to urban transportation were analyzed to predict the future dynamic trends of the key indices and prioritize the sustainable transportation strategies for a livable city under dynamic temporal and spatial changes.

Digital footprints: Using WiFi probe and locational data to analyze human mobility trajectories in cities,Traunmueller M.W.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.07.006,65,False,New York University,New York,United States,"City governments all over the world face challenges understanding mobility patterns within dense urban environments at high spatial and temporal resolution. While such measures are important to provide insights into the functional patterns of a city, novel quantitative methods, derived from ubiquitous mobile connectivity, are needed to provide policy-makers with better insights to improve urban management and planning decisions. In this paper, we develop a model that uses large-scale WiFi probe request data to model urban mobility trajectories in dense urban environments. We collect probe request data from a public Wifi network with 54 access points in the Lower Manhattan section of New York City over one week, accounting for more than 30 million observations and over 800,000 unique devices. First, we aggregate unique entries per access point and per hour, demonstrating the potential to use WiFi data to approximate local population counts by type of user. We then use a spatial network analysis to identify edge frequencies and directions of journeys between the network nodes, and apply the results to the road and pedestrian sidewalk network to identify usage intensity levels and trajectories for individual street segments. We demonstrate the significant potential in the use of WiFi probe request data for understanding mobility patterns in cities, while highlighting non-trivial issues in data privacy raised by the growing availability of public WiFi networks.","['patterns', 'management', 'points', 'decisions', 'new', 'use', 'ubiquitous', 'privacy', 'high', 'million', 'improve', 'segments', 'policymakers', 'measures', 'journeys', 'york', 'cities', 'trajectories', 'insights', 'needed', 'request', 'connectivity', 'temporal', 'sidewalk', 'quantitative', 'levels', 'entries', 'highlighting', 'population', 'devices', 'manhattan', 'significant', 'apply', 'per', 'street', 'provide', 'pedestrian', 'network', 'road', 'directions', 'usage', 'novel', 'world', 'access', 'challenges', 'better', 'availability', 'wifi', 'collect', 'user', 'demonstrating', 'largescale', 'type', 'edge', 'public', 'important', 'probe', 'one', 'growing', 'face', 'local', 'dense', 'week', 'hour', 'demonstrate', 'governments', 'intensity', 'lower', 'within', 'resolution', 'unique', 'counts', 'aggregate', 'point', 'develop', 'individual', 'city', 'uses', 'mobile', 'potential', 'mobility', 'frequencies', 'nontrivial', 'networks', 'environments', 'issues', 'functional', 'accounting', 'first', 'section', 'approximate', 'identify', 'observations', 'raised', 'derived', 'nodes']",2018,"[(1, 0.9985581)]"
The impact of urban growth patterns on urban vitality in newly built-up areas based on an association rules analysis using geographical ‘big data’,He Q.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.020,178,False,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Wuhan,China,"The emergence of geographical ‘big data’ provides new opportunities for studying urban issues. This study uses geographical ‘big data’ on point of interest density (POID), degree of urban function mixing (MIX), location check-in density (CIQD), housing prices (HP), and population change (POPC) to measure the urban vitality of patches of new development that occurred in Chinese cities from 2005 to 2015. The study uses association rule analysis to explore the relationship between different urban growth patterns on urban vitality, and the results indicate that different forms of urban growth have different effects on urban vitality. Infilling is characterized by high values for point of interest density and location check-in density with low values for urban function mixing and mixed values for population change. Edge-expansion is associated with high values for population change and urban function mixtures. Outlying expansion is associated with several negative values for urban vitality, particularly variables related to interactions between people and the environment around them (CIQD). The results indicate that cities may utilize these different forms of urban growth patterns to achieve different goals; for example, infilling may be more effective for office-style development in areas with existing higher population density and urban function mixtures, and edge-expansion may be effective for rapidly absorbing large populations and hosting urban functions that require larger footprints. As such, Chinese cities currently undergoing early stages of development should pursue high-intensity edge-expansion development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the relationship between urban expansion types and urban vitality through the use of ‘big data,’ and the results of this study can provide guidance on urban spatial development for government leaders and researchers in the future.","['patterns', 'mixed', 'new', 'existing', 'several', 'large', 'use', 'relationship', 'patches', 'high', 'require', 'stages', 'attempt', 'geographical', 'associated', 'hosting', 'goals', 'footprints', 'cities', 'forms', 'currently', 'vitality', 'outlying', 'mix', 'leaders', 'undergoing', 'mixtures', 'interactions', 'location', 'population', 'effective', 'provide', 'mixing', 'edgeexpansion', 'higher', 'guidance', 'utilize', 'rule', 'rapidly', 'may', 'characterized', 'variables', 'prices', 'measure', 'degree', 'areas', 'housing', 'emergence', 'provides', 'around', 'types', 'chinese', 'early', 'checkin', 'expansion', 'growth', 'negative', 'related', 'occurred', 'absorbing', 'highintensity', 'association', 'function', 'authors', 'achieve', 'particularly', 'people', 'low', 'populations', 'point', 'effects', 'government', 'uses', 'larger', 'interest', 'hp', 'example', 'functions', 'density', 'explore', 'issues', 'popc', 'first', 'poid', 'researchers', 'studying', 'different', 'ciqd', 'officestyle', 'change', 'future', 'indicate', 'best', 'pursue', 'environment', 'infilling', 'values', 'opportunities']",2018,"[(0, 0.4523163), (1, 0.54663867)]"

While cloaked under the rhetoric of ‘sharing’, the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good.

Geolocated social media as a rapid indicator of park visitation and equitable park access,Hamstead Z.A.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.01.007,244,True,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Buffalo,United States,"Understanding why some parks are used more regularly or intensely than others can inform ways in which urban parkland is developed and managed to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding urban population. Although geolocated social media (GSM) indicators have been used to examine park visitation rates, studies applying this approach are generally limited to flagship parks, national parks, or a small subset of urban parks. Here, we use geolocated Flickr and Twitter data to explore variation in use across New York City's 2143 diverse parks and model visitation based on spatially-explicit park characteristics and facilities, neighborhood-level accessibility features and neighborhood-level demographics. Findings indicate that social media activity in parks is positively correlated with proximity to public transportation and bike routes, as well as particular park characteristics such as water bodies, athletic facilities, and impervious surfaces, but negatively associated with green space and increased proportion of minority ethnicity and minority race in neighborhoods in which parks are located. Contrary to previous studies which describe park visitation as a form of nature-based recreation, our findings indicate that the kinds of green spaces present in many parks may not motivate visitation. From a social equity perspective, our findings may imply that parks in high-minority neighborhoods are not as accessible, do not accommodate as many visitors, and/or are of lower quality than those in low-minority neighborhoods. These implications are consistent with previous studies showing that minority populations disproportionately experience barriers to park access.

Digital planning tools are on the cusp of systematic adoption by councils and metropolitan planning agencies to support data-driven city planning. Whilst much work has been done in opening up property data assets across governments, significant work is required on data standards, interoperability and data sharing across government, industry and the non-profit sectors. Blockchain is considered a new and emerging technology with numerous potential benefits across the housing sector. The Smart Cities movement offers opportunities to undertake pilots and consider new and disruptive technologies. This project maps the ‘disruptive technology ecosystem’ to show how new digital technologies might reshape housing provision and assistance. It is part of a wider evidence-based Policy Inquiry into the impacts of disruptive technologies on different housing markets across Australia, and how policy makers, providers and consumers can engage productively with emerging digital and disruptive technologies. This report specifically provides a critical review of how different emerging digital and disruptive technologies are being incorporated into the housing and planning systems and how they might facilitate greater efficiencies and new opportunities broadly across the housing sector. Through a qualitative approach, the outcomes of a detailed literature review of such innovations are complemented by two technology workshops with stakeholders (social housing providers, local councils, advocacy groups, peak bodies, and technologists) to collaboratively explore implementation options.

Utilizing mobile signaling data, this study proposes an approach to identify park users and the location of their home, and ultimately investigates the differences in user home-park distances for parks with different characteristics. Mobile signaling data analyzed in this study involve 22.3 million mobiles during a period of 24 h in the city of Shanghai. 51,686 users of the 46 sampling parks and location of their home were identified based on their mobile connections to park-related mobile base stations. Correlation and Dunnett T3 test analyses indicate that on average, parks with larger surface area and in denser areas attract further users.

Estimating the effects of “community opening” policy on alleviating traffic congestion in large Chinese cities by integrating ant colony optimization and complex network analyses,Yao Y.,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.03.005,36,False,China University of Geosciences,Wuhan,China,"According to an urban planning directive issued by the Chinese Central Government in early 2016, the Community Opening Policy will be put on the agenda to ameliorate transportation networks, which has aroused much attention regarding the coming changes in traffic, especially in road network structures. Nevertheless, few studies were concerned with the direct and indirect impacts of opening gated communities. This study aims to analyze the impact of opening gated communities on road structure by integrating ant colony optimization (ACO) and complex graph theory and to investigate its influence on resident commuting efficiency and the traffic flow centroid. First, with a traffic road network based on OpenStreetMap (OSM), alteration in the connectivity between two road nodes and the resident overall commuting time and distance are computed using an ACO algorithm. Second, using complex graph theory, the attraction index of every road is calculated, and the congestion area before and after the opening policy is obtained. The research areas include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, which are first-tier Chinese cities. The results demonstrate that opening gated communities will increase the connectivity and accessibility of the current road network by 9.43–29.80%, generating a decrease of 2.57–4.50% in resident commuting time for short-distance travel. Furthermore, with the decline in traffic stream in the urban trunk roads, the number of potentially congested junctions will decrease, resulting in an alteration in the spatial position and coverage area of the urban congestion areas.

Evaluating the services and facilities of European cities using crowdsourced place data,Spyratos S.,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,10.1177/0265813516686070,19,False,University of Thessaly,Volos,Greece,"Statistics about citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services are required for governing urban areas. Such statistics are often unavailable or outdated. At times, existing statistics are irrelevant to the major problems of most citizens. In this article, we propose a cost-effective method for estimating citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services using crowdsourced place data. Two indicators are proposed based on place data derived from the Foursquare social media application. Both indicators are based on the hypothesis that the higher the number of places is that belong to a facility or service type on social media, then the higher the satisfaction of citizens regarding this facility or service type will be. This hypothesis was tested by using the Eurobarometer survey data as reference. The accuracy assessment revealed strong and statistically significant linear relationships (R2 ˃ 0.6) between the reference percentage of very satisfied citizens and some categories (i.e. “Sport facilities”, “Cultural Categories,” and “Streets & buildings”). Other categories showed moderate and statistically significant linear relationships (i.e. “Public spaces” and “Green spaces”). Therefore, the proposed indicators provide estimates about citizen satisfaction with regard to these five categories.

First, potential vegetation classes were identified based on their heights and spectral behavior, all sourced from very high resolution stereo satellite imagery. Then locations of societal demand for green space provision were identified by using attribute and spatial information from census tracks. By using OpenStreetMap road network, the data analysis will measure distances between population with green space demand and existing green spaces, compares the results with actual green space visits, and finally proposes potential vegetation patches which can be transferred to community utilization.

It comes into being with the development of industrialization and urbanization to the advanced stage. The formation and development of urban agglomeration is a long natural process, which is transformed from competition to cooperation.

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning.

The IoT for smart sustainable cities of the future: An analytical framework for sensor-based big data applications for environmental sustainability,Bibri S.E.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2017.12.034,529,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.","['models', 'goal', 'management', 'number', 'several', 'large', 'prevalent', 'enabled', 'tested', 'deal', 'topical', 'realm', 'ignore', 'open', 'infrastructures', 'well', 'making', 'natural', 'considering', 'components', 'efficiency', 'associated', 'therefore', 'literature', 'discussing', 'inform', 'together', 'relevant', 'smart', 'things', 'cities', 'add', 'contribution', 'proposed', 'optimizing', 'mix', 'resources', 'two', 'role', 'including', 'identifying', 'fall', 'across', 'sustainable', 'initiatives', 'synthesize', 'effective', 'sustainability', 'discusses', 'replicated', 'due', 'economic', 'analytical', 'sensorbased', 'advance', 'basis', 'addition', 'scholars', 'environmentally', 'novel', 'empirical', 'originality', 'clearly', 'terms', 'provides', 'stateoftheart', 'challenges', 'penetrative', 'achieved', 'benefits', 'thematic', 'previous', 'paradigms', 'experts', 'analytics', 'computing', 'growth', 'approaches', 'great', 'connection', 'internet', 'required', 'many', 'one', 'related', 'mainly', 'technologies', 'studies', 'draw', 'strategies', 'pertains', 'advanced', 'utilization', 'key', 'specific', 'serves', 'gained', 'planners', 'enhanced', 'proposes', 'path', 'achieve', 'emerging', 'augmenting', 'pertaining', 'landscape', 'overarching', 'energy', 'context', 'effects', 'intelligent', 'infrastructure', 'catalyzing', 'city', 'conducted', 'aim', 'explores', 'furthermore', 'applications', 'review', 'potential', 'largely', 'ict', 'domains', 'short', 'tend', 'opportunity', 'environmental', 'depth', 'issues', 'objective', 'stakeholders', 'without', 'improving', 'life', 'iot', 'conceptual', 'additional', 'field', 'implementing', 'quality', 'projects', 'play', 'facilities', 'researchers', 'visions', 'mitigating', 'delivery', 'support', 'platforms', 'identifies', 'future', 'processing', 'evaluated', 'services', 'environment', 'level', 'brings', 'suits', 'informational', 'directed']",2018,"[(2, 0.99887884)]"
Kuwait urban app: The application of knowledge-based urban development in Kuwait,Gurney R.H.,Knowledge-Based Urban Development in the Middle East,10.4018/978-1-5225-3734-2.ch010,1,False,Kuwait University,Kuwait City,Kuwait,"Through an investigation of social media and contemporary smart phone applications, the urban landscape of Kuwait is analyzed to propose a method for knowledge-based urban development (KBUD).

The promise of KBUD is a more balanced approach towards development, considering economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors. The chapter suggests an up-to-date method of research that consists of three overlapping stages, starting with collecting big data through cellphone software applications, followed by a set of interviews with several entities and ending with a method of behavioral mapping and space syntax.

Towards a critique of cybernetic urbanism: The smart city and the society of control,Krivý M.,Planning Theory,10.1177/1473095216645631,162,False,Estonian Academy of Arts,Tallinn,Estonia,"The smart city has become a hegemonic notion of urban governance, transforming and supplanting planning. The first part of this article reviews current critiques of this notion. Scholars present three main arguments against the smart city: that it is incompatible with an informal character of the city, that it subjects the city to corporate power and that it reproduces social and urban inequalities. It is argued that these critiques either misunderstand how power functions in the smart city or fail to address it as a specific modality of entrepreneurial urban governance. The second part advances an alternative critique, contending that the smart city should be understood as an urban embodiment of the society of control (Deleuze). The smart city is embedded in the intellectual framework of second order cybernetics and articulates urban subjectivity in terms of data flows. Planning as a political practice is superseded by an environmental-behavioural control, in which subjectivity is articulated supra-individually (permeating the city with sensing nodes) and infra-individually (making citizens into sensing nodes).","['cybernetics', 'become', 'governance', 'incompatible', 'fail', 'permeating', 'social', 'transforming', 'misunderstand', 'modality', 'character', 'contending', 'reproduces', 'three', 'address', 'subjectivity', 'infraindividually', 'critiques', 'superseded', 'citizens', 'part', 'functions', 'political', 'environmentalbehavioural', 'inequalities', 'understood', 'reviews', 'power', 'order', 'making', 'entrepreneurial', 'either', 'first', 'informal', 'specific', 'deleuze', 'critique', 'corporate', 'main', 'embedded', 'articulated', 'smart', 'supraindividually', 'alternative', 'scholars', 'hegemonic', 'advances', 'current', 'society', 'articulates', 'notion', 'present', 'practice', 'flows', 'arguments', 'intellectual', 'subjects', 'terms', 'argued', 'second', 'embodiment', 'supplanting', 'sensing', 'nodes', 'city', 'control']",2018,"[(3, 0.99734503)]"
Big data dashboards as smart decision support tools for i-cities – An experiment on stockholm,Kourtit K.,Land Use Policy,10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.019,65,False,Uniwersytet im. Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu,Poznan,Poland,"This study addresses the strategic governance challenges of modern smart cities from the new viewpoint of big data management. It seeks to develop and highlight a systematic methodological framework for handling multivariate big data in a smart urban decision support context in the ‘New Urban World’, so as to enhance the cities’ competitive performance through the design and development of operational urban management principles and strategies. The specific aim of this paper is to provide the critical and basic cornerstones for an applicable interactive dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of innovative city strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic performance. A core element in the present paper is formed by a smart urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool supporting operational choices of all stakeholders involved. This dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases serving as ‘signposts’ of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders. This study thus outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our ‘urban century’, the great potential of digital technology for managing big data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on the basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle.

Have housing prices gone with the smelly wind? Big data analysis on landfill in Hong Kong,Li R.Y.M.,Sustainability (Switzerland),10.3390/su10020341,44,True,Hong Kong Shue Yan University,Hong Kong,China,"Unlikemany other places around the globe, Hong Kong is a small citywith a high population density. Some housing units are built near the sources of an externality, such as a landfill site. As the blocks of buildings are particularly tall, many are walled buildings that block the bad odor from the landfill. Thus, the wind blowing from a landfill site may not affect the entire building estate. Some buildings are more heavily affected than others, partly because walled buildings built near landfills are rare. Only a few studies currently examine the correlation between wind direction and the prices of walled buildings. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by illustrating Hong Kong as a case study. Most previous research studies only examine a few factors affecting housing prices. Modern big data is characterized by its large volume of data, which includes various types of data that analysts would not necessarily sample, but instead merely observe to track what happens. Therefore, another innovative point of our paper, is that we adopt a big data approach to study this issue. In this aspect, this paper is the first of its kind. There are 53,071 observations in the 1999 to 2014 dataset, with 2,175,911 data entries. Our results reflect that when more municipal solid waste is sent to the South East New Territories Landfill, residents' complaints in Tseung Kwan O increase. However, entire property prices in the region also increase, which rejects our hypothesis. We speculate that as more people become aware of the housing estate due to complaints, with only a limited number of housing units affected by the smell, since the wind usually only blows in certain directions, the ""advertisement effect"" originating from complaints about the bad smell boosts the property prices of the unaffected units. That is, people become aware of the existence of the property, visit the site, and discover that only specific units facing one particular direction are affected. Then, they purchase units that are unaffected by the smelly wind, leading to an overall increase in property prices. The study's results may provide a new perspective on urban planning, and possible implications for other cities in view of the constant increase in population and expansion of landfill sites.","['become', 'facing', 'new', 'number', 'illustrating', 'case', 'large', 'high', 'places', 'constant', 'unaffected', 'view', 'various', 'analysts', 'therefore', 'modern', 'implications', 'would', 'limited', 'buildings', 'purchase', 'citywith', 'necessarily', 'entire', 'hong', 'cities', 'currently', 'bridge', 'correlation', 'happens', 'tall', 'estate', 'south', 'block', 'innovative', 'kong', 'bad', 'hypothesis', 'entries', 'since', 'track', 'blowing', 'another', 'population', 'kwan', 'waste', 'affected', 'leading', 'dataset', 'landfill', 'globe', 'due', 'provide', 'externality', 'reflect', 'may', 'directions', 'characterized', 'prices', 'solid', 'affecting', 'housing', 'around', 'types', 'smelly', 'discover', 'sent', 'previous', 'expansion', 'merely', 'instead', 'perspective', 'property', 'boosts', 'territories', 'sites', 'heavily', 'many', 'one', 'others', 'studies', 'factors', 'affect', 'wind', 'gap', 'specific', 'municipal', 'rare', 'built', 'includes', 'increase', 'blows', 'east', 'existence', 'studys', 'particularly', 'complaints', 'odor', 'people', 'overall', 'visit', 'small', 'adopt', 'particular', 'partly', 'unlikemany', 'point', 'sample', 'rejects', 'certain', 'direction', 'originating', 'aim', 'walled', 'examine', 'kind', 'blocks', 'issue', 'density', 'landfills', 'volume', 'near', 'advertisement', 'building', 'first', 'tseung', 'region', 'residents', 'aspect', 'effect', 'possible', 'smell', 'thus', 'sources', 'speculate', 'usually', 'observations', 'site', 'observe', 'units', 'aware']",2018,"[(1, 0.999017)]"
"Systems Thinking and Complexity Science and the Relevance of Big Data Analytics, Intelligence Functions, and Simulation Models",Bibri S.E.,Urban Book Series,10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_6,2,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Smart sustainable cities are complex systems par excellence. This is manifested in a variety of ways to think of and define the underlying many subsystems as connected and joined together by a web of relationships that interact to produce collective behavior that cannot easily be explained in terms of interactions between the individual constituent elements. As such, they involve special conundrums, intractable problems, and complex challenges pertaining to sustainability and urbanization. It follows that to deal with such systems requires newfangled ways founded on more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods with respect to how cities can be monitored, understood, managed, planned, and developed. This necessitates leveraging the advance and prevalence of ICT in the transition toward the needed sustainable urban development in an increasingly urbanized and computerized world. Importantly, smart sustainable cities require advanced thinking approaches to be well understood and illuminated so as to enable more effective actions necessary for enhancing their functioning and adaptation in ways that guide their development toward sustainability. The aim of this chapter is twofold. Grounded in systems thinking and complexity science as theoretic approaches, this chapter endeavors to systematically explore the key underlying structures, behavioral patterns, conditions, relationships, and interactions pertaining to smart sustainable cities as complex systems, and to elucidate the related principles in terms of methods, mechanisms, and goals. The intent of offering the knowledge to describe and analyze such systems accordingly is to surface noteworthy relationships as well as their implications for sustainability so as to provoke thought, foster deeper understanding, and create fertile insights, with the primary purpose of making visible possible places for actions that improve the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This can be accomplished by means of devising powerful urban intelligence functions and robust urban simulation models for strategic decision-making based on big data analytics in conjunction with urban design concepts and planning principles of sustainability. Accordingly, this chapter also discusses the potential of big data analytics and related urban intelligence functions and urban simulation models for, and the role of urban design in, catalyzing and advancing the strategic process of sustainable development by proposing innovative approaches and solutions for monitoring, managing, planning, and designing smart sustainable cities of the future. The main argument is that the systems thinking and complexity science are integral to the understanding of smart sustainable cities, which is a moving target in that they are becoming more complex through the very technologies being used to understand them. Moreover, advanced ICT is founded on the application of complexity theory to urban problems in terms of tracking the changing dynamics, disentangling the intractable problems, and tackling the challenges pertaining to urban systems, which are in and of themselves becoming ever more complex. As high-performance computers have become an indispensable source of information, complex systems cannot be understood and studied without the use of computers and big data analytics.","['describe', 'intelligence', 'models', 'patterns', 'become', 'can', 'not', 'developed', 'systems', 'web', 'theoretic', 'highperformance', 'use', 'deal', 'indispensable', 'noteworthy', 'analyze', 'require', 'decisionmaking', 'advancing', 'places', 'relationships', 'well', 'making', 'improve', 'transition', 'surface', 'tackling', 'implications', 'monitored', 'actions', 'goals', 'together', 'argument', 'smart', 'twofold', 'conditions', 'cities', 'easily', 'systematically', 'special', 'contribution', 'strategic', 'computers', 'insights', 'needed', 'monitoring', 'managing', 'changing', 'newfangled', 'devising', 'sophisticated', 'constituent', 'elements', 'joined', 'role', 'innovative', 'importantly', 'par', 'grounded', 'interactions', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'concepts', 'effective', 'problems', 'endeavors', 'sustainability', 'increasingly', 'discusses', 'intent', 'understood', 'becoming', 'follows', 'understand', 'requires', 'toward', 'leveraging', 'advance', 'urbanized', 'manifested', 'moving', 'functioning', 'provoke', 'behavioral', 'world', 'underlying', 'integral', 'guide', 'terms', 'challenges', 'enable', 'managed', 'means', 'intractable', 'powerful', 'involve', 'collective', 'simulation', 'analytics', 'visible', 'enhancing', 'approaches', 'behavior', 'explained', 'ways', 'complexity', 'solutions', 'related', 'technologies', 'principles', 'foster', 'robust', 'advanced', 'key', 'necessary', 'urbanization', 'produce', 'main', 'chapter', 'create', 'think', 'subsystems', 'conundrums', 'pertaining', 'prevalence', 'founded', 'science', 'primary', 'necessitates', 'thought', 'tracking', 'excellence', 'thinking', 'variety', 'respect', 'individual', 'purpose', 'planned', 'dynamics', 'catalyzing', 'designing', 'aim', 'accomplished', 'deeper', 'ever', 'potential', 'ict', 'source', 'disentangling', 'functions', 'target', 'connected', 'explore', 'offering', 'without', 'studied', 'mechanisms', 'elucidate', 'possible', 'accordingly', 'structures', 'future', 'define', 'adaptation', 'illuminated', 'moreover', 'interact', 'proposing', 'computerized', 'conjunction', 'many', 'fertile']",2018,"[(0, 0.36987966), (2, 0.30906263), (3, 0.320533)]"
Unprecedented Innovations in Sustainable Urban Planning: Novel Analytical Solutions and Data-Driven Decision-Making Processes,Bibri S.E.,Urban Book Series,10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_5,6,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"City planning is drastically changing with regard to the way urban systems can function and be managed and developed in line with the goals of sustainable development. Marking and fueling this change predominately is the increasing use and application of big data and data-driven decision-making in urban analytics and planning to advance the contribution of cities to sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been instigated by the recent advances in data science and its becoming a more accessible tool to advocacy groups, more extensive data and their new sources being able to potentially allow key stakeholders to see and respond to various urban factors (mobility, transport, energy, environment, public health care, education, etc.) in real time, coupled with citizens emitting rich spatiotemporal data to an increasing extent through the use of various technologies. We refer to big data with respect to their humongous size and wide variety but pay particular attention to urban data, i.e., data invariably tagged with spatial and temporal labels; largely streamed from diverse sensory sources and stored in databases; generated routinely, automatically, and sporadically; and merged and coalesced in data warehouses for use at the citywide scale. This epitomizes a sea change in the data that we generate about urban systems as to what happens and where, when, how, and why in the urban environment. This is opening entirely new windows of opportunity for the application of analytical solutions and data-driven decision-making approaches into urban planning in terms of improving the performance of, and contribution to, the goals of sustainable development under what is termed smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores the real potential of big data and data-driven decision-making for revolutionizing or transforming the process of planning for the purpose of achieving the goals of sustainable development in the context of smart sustainable cities, focusing on different dimensions and functions of planning as well as their synergy and integration. We argue that the increasing proliferation and availability of urban data, coupled with the continuous integration of new and more extensive sources of such data as well as the evolving development of big data technologies, are increasingly enabling novel analytical solutions for, or sophisticated engineering approaches into, advancing the process of sustainable urban development, in addition to seamlessly integrating long-term strategic planning with short-term thinking about how cities can function and be managed in the context of sustainability. In addition, we believe that big data innovations entail how new data-driven transformations are facilitated and applied as well as diffused throughout urban systems, rather than simply denoting a significant growth in volume and variety of urban data.","['coupled', 'new', 'developed', 'systems', 'epitomizes', 'transforming', 'use', 'applied', 'generate', 'tagged', 'warehouses', 'ie', 'decisionmaking', 'marking', 'advancing', 'proliferation', 'allow', 'education', 'well', 'integration', 'dimensions', 'time', 'various', 'line', 'continuous', 'seamlessly', 'scale', 'synergy', 'goals', 'datadriven', 'extensive', 'smart', 'labels', 'cities', 'emitting', 'strategic', 'contribution', 'windows', 'happens', 'recent', 'changing', 'sophisticated', 'longterm', 'revolutionizing', 'termed', 'temporal', 'tool', 'automatically', 'sustainable', 'wide', 'way', 'significant', 'sustainability', 'increasingly', 'citizens', 'pay', 'shift', 'streamed', 'becoming', 'analytical', 'potentially', 'advance', 'achieving', 'entail', 'advances', 'addition', 'refer', 'novel', 'engineering', 'rather', 'transport', 'entirely', 'terms', 'availability', 'managed', 'evolving', 'analytics', 'growth', 'approaches', 'generated', 'public', 'citywide', 'predominately', 'routinely', 'solutions', 'technologies', 'coalesced', 'merged', 'care', 'factors', 'extent', 'key', 'drastically', 'see', 'health', 'believe', 'function', 'accessible', 'instigated', 'chapter', 'simply', 'rich', 'fueling', 'science', 'increasing', 'particular', 'energy', 'focusing', 'diffused', 'context', 'innovations', 'thinking', 'variety', 'opening', 'respect', 'purpose', 'sensory', 'city', 'groups', 'attention', 'explores', 'sporadically', 'transformations', 'potential', 'largely', 'mobility', 'argue', 'size', 'opportunity', 'functions', 'shortterm', 'stakeholders', 'volume', 'respond', 'improving', 'advocacy', 'databases', 'real', 'spatiotemporal', 'different', 'invariably', 'diverse', 'throughout', 'able', 'facilitated', 'sea', 'integrating', 'change', 'sources', 'humongous', 'environment', 'regard', 'denoting', 'enabling', 'stored', 'etc', 'unprecedented']",2018,"[(0, 0.58162874), (3, 0.41748294)]"
Managing Urban Complexity: Project and Risk Management and Polycentric and Participatory Governance,Bibri S.E.,Urban Book Series,10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_8,2,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"The widespread dissemination of sustainability, the rapid urbanization of the world, and the global rise of ICT are the three most important global trends at play across the urban world today. They will most likely change the way cities can be managed and developed drastically. They are also rendering the tasks of urban management increasingly more challenging on many scales with regard to city development. This implies that the management of urban systems and what they entail in terms of operations, functions, processes, and services in the context of smart sustainable cities require complex interdisciplinary knowledge pertaining not only to project management and multiscale and participatory governance, but also to the administration of ICT and related computational and data analytics processes. These three urban management functions are particularly associated with significant risks and challenges that need to be managed and overcome, respectively, in the process of making decisions as part of the development of smart sustainable cities of the future. However, topical studies on project management, governance, and risk management approach these topics from a general perspective predominantly. From a somewhat specific perspective, the focus in this chapter is rather on these urban management functions in relation to smart sustainable cities as having distinctive characteristics with respect to both the ubiquity presence and massive use of ICT and what this entails in terms of information security risks as well as the complexity of multiscale and participatory governance structures and project management processes. This chapter intends to explore urban and ICT project and related risk management in the context of smart sustainable cities, as well as the various models of governance of their functioning and development. The emphasis in risk management is placed on both urban development and ICT projects as well as information security in relation to the use of cloud computing as an increasingly widely applied solution for big data and context-aware applications. As to governance models, we put emphasis on polycentric, participatory, and big data forms.

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. In addition, since the area of smart sustainable cities is not a specific direction of research, it does not have a unitary framework in terms of a uniform set of concepts and theories. Indeed, it represents multiple, diverse research directions and thus various inquiry approaches, including theoretical, applied theoretical, exploratory, empirical, and futuristic. These may be analytically quite diverse. The approach to this scholarly endeavor is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to assess, advance, and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities of the future.” This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant concepts, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this chapter endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental concepts and theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society.

Integrated Planning Approach to Climate Resilient and Low-Carbon Smart Cities: Process and Methods,Kim K.,Urban Book Series,10.1007/978-3-319-59618-1_3,3,False,University College London,London,United Kingdom,"This chapter examines an integrated planning approach to climate resilient and low-carbon smart cities in terms of process and methods. Management of urban areas and their growth and spatial planning require incorporating disaster risk management and the climate change agenda as essential components of urban development. Only by merging these components and utilizing the sustainable smart planning tools available to us can adaptation and mitigation for global climate change be integrated into our future urban plans.

There are huge investment opportunities associated with new implementation of climate smart cities in four distinct areas: framework, partnership, financial plan, and implementation arrangements. A platform based on these four elements could provide guidance on how climate smart urban development and infrastructure projects can be integrated into smart city planning processes. It could be built in a way that unlocks the value added of a digitalized urban ecosystem that helps address sources of climate change, impacts, and solution. On the whole, the fusion of information and communication technologies and ubiquitous urban information seems to be key to enhancing the role and value of a platform to build climate smart cities.

Transitioning from Smart Cities to Smarter Cities: The Future Potential of ICT of Pervasive Computing for Advancing Environmental Sustainability,Bibri S.E.,Urban Book Series,10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_10,14,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Smart cities are evolving and ever changing, i.e., morphing into new faces. This is being fueled by the rapid computerization and urbanization of the world, driven by the evolvement of ICT visions of various forms of pervasive computing into deployable and achievable computing paradigms, as well as by the perceived role of advanced ICT in overcoming the challenge of urbanization. Indeed, visions of noteworthy advances in computing and ICT bring with them wide-ranging common visions on how cities as social fabrics will evolve in the future along with the immense opportunities and potential threats such future will bring. However, there are several critical issues that remain largely ignored concerning smarter cities. In particular, smarter (and smart) cities involve several problems—when it comes to their development and implementation as to their concrete contribution to and explicit incorporation of the fundamental goal of environmentally sustainable development. They moreover pose many risks to environmental sustainability due to the ubiquity of computing and the massive use of ICT throughout all urban domains. Also, relatively little or no attention has been given to smarter cities as future visions of smart cities in terms of the potential of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing to respond to the challenge of environmental sustainability. In addition, it is important not to conceive of smarter cities as “isolated islands”, like some urban scholars might presume. Instead, the interplay between such cities and other scales, as well as the links to political and regulatory processes on a macro level have to be recognized. The purpose of this chapter is manifold. First, it reviews the key deficiencies, misunderstandings, fallacies, and challenges associated with smart and smarter cities with respect to environmental sustainability. Second, it identifies the significant risks that smarter cities pose to environmental sustainability, which are expected to escalate during the transition of smart cities to smarter cities. Third, it substantiates the potential that smarter cities hold in accelerating and advancing environmental sustainability on the basis of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing. The underlying assumption is that smarter cities are still at the early stage of their development and thus could, if planned strategically, do a lot more in this regard, including the mitigation of environmental risks posed by ICT itself, if linked to the goal of environmentally sustainable development. Fourth, this chapter endeavors to reflect on what it means for smart cities to move behind their foundational visions as they transition to smarter cities and embrace environmental sustainability as an important trend increasingly gaining prominence in urban development as a result of the unprecedented urbanization of the world. Fifth, this chapter probes both the ways in which the transition of smart cities to smarter cities (with environmental sustainability in mind) can be managed or governed at the macro level as well as the role of politics and policy in the creation and evolution of smarter cities. This entails drawing on different theoretical perspectives from socio-technical studies, innovation studies, and discursive studies, most notably transition governance; technological and national innovation systems; and the link between political practice and the emergence, insertion, and functioning of new discourses.","['goal', 'new', 'social', 'fabrics', 'several', 'ignored', 'systems', 'common', 'use', 'evolution', 'result', 'technological', 'noteworthy', 'deficiencies', 'achievable', 'ie', 'advancing', 'faces', 'entails', 'theoretical', 'well', 'politics', 'various', 'indeed', 'evolve', 'comes', 'associated', 'expected', 'might', 'transition', 'evolvement', 'rapid', 'ubiquity', 'hold', 'perspectives', 'smart', 'concerning', 'escalate', 'cities', 'move', 'deployable', 'forms', 'contribution', 'notably', 'sociotechnical', 'changing', 'mind', 'pose', 'second', 'substantiates', 'role', 'discursive', 'links', 'including', 'driven', 'computerization', 'remain', 'sustainable', 'overcoming', 'trend', 'endeavors', 'stage', 'significant', 'sustainability', 'problemswhen', 'increasingly', 'conceive', 'fundamental', 'gaining', 'presume', 'due', 'challenge', 'processes', 'drawing', 'reflect', 'incorporation', 'could', 'basis', 'advances', 'addition', 'scholars', 'mitigation', 'environmentally', 'functioning', 'morphing', 'pervasive', 'implementation', 'world', 'underlying', 'emergence', 'discourses', 'terms', 'challenges', 'managed', 'means', 'perceived', 'fallacies', 'involve', 'immense', 'early', 'paradigms', 'islands', 'instead', 'evolving', 'fifth', 'computing', 'along', 'regulatory', 'explicit', 'important', 'ways', 'political', 'bring', 'little', 'studies', 'national', 'reviews', 'foundational', 'advanced', 'key', 'interplay', 'urbanization', 'chapter', 'assumption', 'scales', 'third', 'still', 'practice', 'isolated', 'fourth', 'particular', 'manifold', 'like', 'respect', 'purpose', 'planned', 'insertion', 'fueled', 'policy', 'governance', 'given', 'posed', 'attention', 'ever', 'lot', 'potential', 'largely', 'behind', 'relatively', 'smarter', 'ict', 'domains', 'linked', 'accelerating', 'environmental', 'issues', 'massive', 'link', 'macro', 'innovation', 'concrete', 'respond', 'critical', 'first', 'threats', 'risks', 'different', 'visions', 'recognized', 'throughout', 'identifies', 'strategically', 'creation', 'wideranging', 'future', 'thus', 'governed', 'moreover', 'prominence', 'misunderstandings', 'level', 'regard', 'many', 'probes', 'unprecedented', 'embrace', 'opportunities']",2018,"[(2, 0.9958444)]"

The smart city paradigm is strongly connected to researches based on big data. The main objective of this paper is to strengthen the idea of usefulness of big data in examining and developing the urban transportation system as part of smart cities. In this pilot research, Google Maps traffic estimation data were used to evaluate the special vehicular traffic flows in District 3, in Budapest. On 45 defined road sections, travel time estimation data were collected with the aim to calculate the extent of wasted time in traffic jams. According to our results this source of ‘big data’ is a feasible way of conducting ‘smart’ research on a city road system. The most relevant advantage of this database is that it is continually generated on a high spatial and temporal resolution. The conclusion of this pilot research is that spatial and temporal inequalities are evincible from this database, unrecognized processes can be easily analysed, which can help urban planners to rethink their strategies on urban transport system. The most important findings showed that, on workdays, there is a second wave of peak traffic on many roads, and, within our chosen district, there are congestion hot spot places.

A closer look at the foundations and methods that underlie these exercises offers important lessons I examine the practice of opportunity mapping from both theoretical and methodological perspectives, highlighting several weaknesses of the common methods. Following this, I outline a theoretical framework based on Galster’s categorization of the mechanisms of neighborhood effects.

The model provides estimates of four latent variables conceived as the essential dimensions of spatial opportunity: social-interactive, environmental, geographic, and institutional.

Integrating multi-source big data to infer building functions,Niu N.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2017.1325489,99,False,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"Information about the functions of urban buildings is helpful not only for developing a better understanding of how cities work, but also for establishing a basis for policy makers to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of urban planning. Despite these advantages, however, and perhaps simply due to a lack of available data, few academic studies to date have succeeded in integrating multi-source ‘big data’ to examine urban land use at the building level. Responding to this deficiency, this study integrated multi-source big data (WeChat users’ real-time location records, taxi GPS trajectories data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and building footprint data from high-resolution Quickbird images), and applied the proposed density-based method to infer the functions of urban buildings in Tianhe District, Guangzhou, China. The results of the study conformed to an overall detection rate of 72.22%. When results were verified against ground-truth investigation data, the accuracy rate remained above 65%. Two important conclusions can be drawn from our analysis: 1.The use of WeChat data delivers better inference results than those obtained using taxi data when used to identify residential buildings, offices, and urban villages. Conversely, shopping centers, hotels, and hospitals, were more easily identified using taxi data. 2. The use of integrated multi-source big data is more effective than single-source big data in revealing the relation between human dynamics and urban complexes at the building scale.","['points', 'inference', 'helpful', 'makers', 'use', 'applied', 'academic', 'method', 'human', 'drawn', 'district', 'conclusions', 'perhaps', 'tianhe', 'improve', 'users', 'scale', 'buildings', 'footprint', 'cities', 'easily', 'proposed', 'trajectories', 'infer', 'two', 'effectiveness', 'location', 'multisource', 'realtime', 'effective', 'hospitals', 'singlesource', 'detection', 'due', 'villages', 'basis', 'relation', 'integrated', 'revealing', 'residential', 'better', 'developing', 'densitybased', 'rate', 'wechat', 'quickbird', 'verified', 'records', 'important', 'obtained', 'responding', 'studies', 'despite', 'available', 'advantages', 'taxi', 'shopping', 'simply', 'establishing', 'land', 'overall', 'lack', 'succeeded', 'identified', 'highresolution', 'conversely', 'dynamics', 'work', 'date', 'policy', 'hotels', 'examine', 'investigation', 'interest', 'gps', 'functions', 'offices', 'building', 'centers', 'complexes', 'conformed', 'evaluate', 'groundtruth', 'remained', 'identify', 'guangzhou', 'delivers', 'integrating', 'accuracy', 'poi', 'deficiency', 'images', 'level']",2017,"[(1, 0.9985117)]"

How to accurately position the protection and utilization of districts and achieve its healthy and sustainable development is the key work in the protection of districts. In this paper, the Internet data including Tencent's location big data are employed to study some Chinese historic and cultural streets, establish protection and development index system for historic and cultural streets, carry out in-depth study of ten core indicators, and sum up the positioning and development direction for the protection and use of districts.

ICT of the new wave of computing for sustainable urban forms: Their big data and context-aware augmented typologies and design concepts,Bibri S.E.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2017.04.012,122,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.","['models', 'new', 'method', 'deal', 'technological', 'high', 'boundaries', 'human', 'entails', 'well', 'unlock', 'improve', 'evaluating', 'literature', 'relevance', 'goals', 'smart', 'cities', 'form', 'finally', 'objectives', 'forms', 'contribution', 'optimizing', 'mix', 'datacentric', 'inspired', 'sophisticated', 'substantiates', 'two', 'innovative', 'practitioners', 'hitherto', 'sustainable', 'concepts', 'way', 'three', 'unrealized', 'matrix', 'significant', 'sustainability', 'increasingly', 'four', 'need', 'question', 'addressed', 'landscapes', 'advance', 'exploit', 'extend', 'relation', 'scholars', 'addition', 'novel', 'disciplines', 'created', 'world', 'agenda', 'problematic', 'underlying', 'include', 'multiple', 'challenges', 'enable', 'quest', 'thematic', 'immense', 'simulation', 'computing', 'addresses', 'wave', 'embrace', 'leverage', 'typologies', 'required', 'ways', 'solutions', 'related', 'technologies', 'improvement', 'merged', 'merging', 'extent', 'difficult', 'amalgamated', 'built', 'secondary', 'planners', 'function', 'proposes', 'offer', 'beyond', 'achieve', 'overcome', 'still', 'particularly', 'pertaining', 'overall', 'settlements', 'methodologies', 'contextaware', 'city', 'thriveie', 'aim', 'underpinned', 'classes', 'explores', 'opportunities', 'applications', 'review', 'help', 'potential', 'ict', 'issue', 'contemporary', 'investigating', 'environments', 'recognition', 'constructive', 'physical', 'innovation', 'analyzing', 'field', 'real', 'evaluate', 'different', 'embedded', 'efficient', 'identifies', 'current', 'strategically', 'future', 'improved', 'undoubtedly', 'broaden', 'ultimately', 'deemed', 'informational', 'suits', 'qualitative', 'generation', 'ambit', 'horizons']",2017,"[(3, 0.9987729)]"
Mapping fine-scale population distributions at the building level by integrating multisource geospatial big data,Yao Y.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2017.1290252,203,False,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"Fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and disaster prevention. The rapid technological development of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in recent decades has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. However, most of these studies focused on global population and environmental changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. As geospatial big data booms, Internet-collected volunteered geographic information (VGI) can now be used to solve this problem. This article establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions. First, Baidu points-of-interest (POIs) and real-time Tencent user densities (RTUD) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level. Then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model to map population distributions at the building level. Meanwhile, we introduce a densely inhabited index (DII), generated by the proposed gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential crowding. According to a comparison with official community-level census data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method exhibits the best accuracy (Pearson R =.8615, RMSE = 663.3250, p <.0001). The produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.","['models', 'rmse', 'downscale', 'makers', 'method', 'decades', 'technological', 'essential', 'prevention', 'exhibits', 'map', 'geographical', 'global', 'scale', 'rapid', 'produced', 'considered', 'proposed', 'r', 'recent', 'reliable', 'grid', 'resources', 'role', 'communitylevel', 'buildingpopulation', 'distributions', 'remote', 'pois', 'geospatial', 'meanwhile', 'multisource', 'population', 'realtime', 'effective', 'comparison', 'volunteered', 'rtud', 'mapping', 'finescale', 'estimate', 'inhabited', 'numerous', 'novel', 'degree', 'residential', 'densely', 'problem', 'index', 'sensing', 'previous', 'user', 'allocation', 'official', 'baidu', 'generated', 'p', 'disaster', 'analyzed', 'inner', 'studies', 'tencent', 'forest', 'rs', 'local', 'introduce', 'internetcollected', 'geographic', 'offer', 'pointsofinterest', 'random', 'according', 'lack', 'booms', 'changes', 'densities', 'distribution', 'city', 'policy', 'streetlevel', 'gravity', 'focused', 'dii', 'help', 'largely', 'example', 'fields', 'environmental', 'gis', 'optimize', 'iterative', 'pearson', 'building', 'first', 'thorough', 'algorithm', 'play', 'solve', 'crowding', 'integrating', 'thus', 'system', 'accuracy', 'establishes', 'best', 'level', 'benefited', 'vgi', 'census']",2017,"[(1, 0.99872965)]"
"A geo-big data approach to intra-urban food deserts: Transit-varying accessibility, social inequalities, and implications for urban planning",Su S.,Habitat International,10.1016/j.habitatint.2017.04.007,75,False,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"Urban studies attempt to identify the geographic areas with restricted access to healthy and affordable foods (defined as food deserts in the literature). While prior publications have reported the socioeconomic disparities in healthy food accessibility, little evidence has been released from developing countries, especially in China. This paper proposes a geo-big data approach to measuring transit-varying healthy food accessibility and applies it to identify the food deserts within Shenzhen, China. In particular, we develop a crawling tool to harvest the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each healthy food store (102) from the Baidu Map under four transport modes (walking, public transit, private car, and bicycle) during 17:30–20:30 in June 2016. Based on the travel time calculations, we develop four travel time indicators to measure the healthy food accessibility: the minimum, the maximum, the weighted average, and the standard deviation. Results show that the four accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the nearest service (minimum time) alone fails to reflect the multidimensional nature of healthy food accessibility. The communities within Shenzhen present quite different typology with respect to healthy food accessibility under different transport modes. Multilevel additive regression is further applied to examine the associations between healthy food accessibility and nested socioeconomic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). We discover that the associations are divergent with transport modes and with geographic levels. More specifically, significant social equalities in healthy food accessibility are identified via walking, public transit, and bicycle in Shenzhen. Based on the associations, we finally map the food deserts and propose corresponding planning strategies. The methods demonstrated in this study should offer deeper spatial insights into intra-urban foodscapes and provide more nuanced understanding of food deserts in urban settings of developing countries.","['transitvarying', 'community', 'social', 'walking', 'applied', 'reported', 'generate', 'disparities', 'nature', 'district', 'fails', 'attempt', 'time', 'map', 'literature', 'estimations', 'finally', 'corresponding', 'present', 'service', 'insights', 'nuanced', 'minimum', 'two', 'levels', 'tool', 'communities', 'equalities', 'divergent', 'significant', 'foods', 'four', 'via', 'specifically', 'provide', 'harvest', 'maximum', 'reflect', 'applies', 'multilevel', 'healthy', 'accessibility', 'deserts', 'measure', 'areas', 'propose', 'access', 'transport', 'measuring', 'average', 'developing', 'settings', 'discover', 'show', 'food', 'baidu', 'private', 'public', 'associations', 'regression', 'nearest', 'deviation', 'little', 'studies', 'indicators', 'prior', 'strategies', 'geobig', 'car', 'socioeconomic', 'typology', 'within', 'geographic', 'proposes', 'travel', 'offer', 'affordable', 'crawling', 'publications', 'weighted', 'calculations', 'shenzhen', 'quite', 'particular', 'identified', 'bicycle', 'alone', 'develop', 'daily', 'respect', 'countries', 'standard', 'store', 'demonstrated', 'examine', 'deeper', 'june', 'foodscapes', 'released', 'modes', 'characteristics', 'multidimensional', 'identify', 'different', 'restricted', 'additive', 'defined', 'especially', 'nested', 'transit', 'intraurban']",2017,"[(1, 0.99875224)]"

In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza’ strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems.

Simulation model of land use dynamics and application: Progress and prospects,Li S.,Yaogan Xuebao/Journal of Remote Sensing,10.11834/jrs.20176159,56,True,Guangzhou University,Guangzhou,China,"Land Use and Land Cover change (LUCC) is a main research subject of global environmental change and sustainable development. LUCC is a complex and dynamic process that involves both natural and human systems. Land use simulation models are powerful tools for understanding the driving forces of LUCC, for supporting urban planning and decision making, and for providing important information to evaluate the ecosystem effects of LUCC. Land use dynamic systems are difficult to predict through traditional ""top-down"" models. The Cellular Automata (CA) model and Agent-Based Model (ABM) are ""bottom-up"" approaches that have attracted increasing attention as powerful modeling tools in simulating land use patterns and evolution processes. In a CA model, each cell has a finite number of states, which can represent land use or land cover types. Changes in individual cells are defined by transition rules and generate the macro pattern of land use changes. The CA model has outstanding advantages in simulating the natural driving factors of land use dynamics. However, the influences of human factors are difficult to represent in a CA model. ABM, by contrast, can reflect the decisions and behaviors of individuals, such as government, investors, and residents. In an ABM, agents can move and interact with each other and with the environment. These local interactions generate certain land use patterns on the global scale. Thus, the two models have distinct advantages in modeling land use dynamics. Currently, the development of the CA and ABM models has achieved several important breakthroughs. This paper summarizes the recent progress in land use simulation models from the perspective of theory and methodology, including scale sensitivity, CA transition and ABM behavior rules, and coupled CA and ABM models. This paper also outlines the applications of these models in virtual city simulation and theoretical verification, realistic city simulation and scenario prediction, multitype land use and cover simulation, and decision support. However, the current land use models have obvious limitations on some crucial issues, such as fine and large-scale simulation. Hence, this paper discusses these problems and proposes the inclusion of three-dimensional modeling, big data, and rule-mining for fine simulation, as well as large-scale simulation and knowledge transfer, in future studies.","['models', 'patterns', 'finite', 'agentbased', 'coupled', 'decisions', 'number', 'systems', 'several', 'use', 'evolution', 'generate', 'outlines', 'simulating', 'human', 'realistic', 'theoretical', 'well', 'making', 'natural', 'providing', 'transition', 'distinct', 'global', 'states', 'scale', 'breakthroughs', 'behaviors', 'move', 'currently', 'traditional', 'recent', 'predict', 'two', 'cell', 'including', 'interactions', 'driving', 'modeling', 'sustainable', 'complex', 'problems', 'discusses', 'dynamic', 'limitations', 'processes', 'individuals', 'reflect', 'hence', 'cells', 'fine', 'achieved', 'types', 'powerful', 'simulation', 'largescale', 'perspective', 'lucc', 'approaches', 'topdown', 'behavior', 'important', 'ca', 'transfer', 'scenario', 'multitype', 'studies', 'inclusion', 'contrast', 'factors', 'local', 'difficult', 'bottomup', 'advantages', 'main', 'proposes', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'verification', 'obvious', 'agents', 'land', 'sensitivity', 'increasing', 'threedimensional', 'abm', 'crucial', 'cover', 'attracted', 'effects', 'changes', 'certain', 'dynamics', 'individual', 'government', 'city', 'summarizes', 'attention', 'ecosystem', 'methodology', 'prediction', 'influences', 'applications', 'progress', 'environmental', 'issues', 'rulemining', 'subject', 'cellular', 'macro', 'automata', 'represent', 'pattern', 'residents', 'evaluate', 'virtual', 'support', 'involves', 'current', 'change', 'thus', 'future', 'defined', 'interact', 'environment', 'forces', 'tools', 'decision', 'investors', 'rules']",2017,"[(1, 0.4292229), (2, 0.5700863)]"
Smart sustainable cities of the future: An extensive interdisciplinary literature review,Bibri S.E.,Sustainable Cities and Society,10.1016/j.scs.2017.02.016,989,False,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications.

Sensing spatial distribution of urban land use by integrating points-of-interest and Google Word2Vec model,Yao Y.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2016.1244608,358,False,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"Urban land use information plays an essential role in a wide variety of urban planning and environmental monitoring processes. During the past few decades, with the rapid technological development of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial big data, numerous methods have been developed to identify urban land use at a fine scale. Points-of-interest (POIs) have been widely used to extract information pertaining to urban land use types and functional zones. However, it is difficult to quantify the relationship between spatial distributions of POIs and regional land use types due to a lack of reliable models. Previous methods may ignore abundant spatial features that can be extracted from POIs. In this study, we establish an innovative framework that detects urban land use distributions at the scale of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) by integrating Baidu POIs and a Word2Vec model. This framework was implemented using a Google open-source model of a deep-learning language in 2013. First, data for the Pearl River Delta (PRD) are transformed into a TAZ-POI corpus using a greedy algorithm by considering the spatial distributions of TAZs and inner POIs. Then, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of POIs and TAZs are extracted using the Word2Vec model. Finally, to validate the reliability of the POI/TAZ vectors, we implement a K-Means-based clustering model to analyze correlations between the POI/TAZ vectors and deploy TAZ vectors to identify urban land use types using a random forest algorithm (RFA) model. Compared with some state-of-the-art probabilistic topic models (PTMs), the proposed method can efficiently obtain the highest accuracy (OA = 0.8728, kappa = 0.8399). Moreover, the results can be used to help urban planners to monitor dynamic urban land use and evaluate the impact of urban planning schemes.","['models', 'developed', 'systems', 'delta', 'use', 'method', 'decades', 'relationship', 'technological', 'analyze', 'ignore', 'highdimensional', 'essential', 'considering', 'rfa', 'river', 'scale', 'traffic', 'abundant', 'rapid', 'finally', 'characteristic', 'deploy', 'proposed', 'clustering', 'monitoring', 'reliable', 'tazpoi', 'role', 'innovative', 'language', 'distributions', 'remote', 'pois', 'geospatial', 'wide', 'implement', 'kappa', 'tazs', 'dynamic', 'due', 'processes', 'schemes', 'numerous', 'may', 'oa', 'vectors', 'validate', 'fine', 'stateoftheart', 'types', 'kmeansbased', 'prd', 'sensing', 'greedy', 'previous', 'reliability', 'baidu', 'transformed', 'inner', 'ptms', 'widely', 'taz', 'compared', 'quantify', 'extract', 'forest', 'rs', 'difficult', 'planners', 'past', 'corpus', 'pearl', 'correlations', 'geographic', 'obtain', 'pointsofinterest', 'random', 'establish', 'plays', 'land', 'pertaining', 'lack', 'variety', 'highest', 'google', 'zones', 'efficiently', 'monitor', 'help', 'extracted', 'detects', 'environmental', 'features', 'gis', 'functional', 'implemented', 'first', 'algorithm', 'evaluate', 'identify', 'opensource', 'integrating', 'accuracy', 'topic', 'moreover', 'deeplearning', 'poitaz', 'probabilistic', 'regional']",2017,"[(1, 0.99874115)]"
Urban Resilience and Planning Support Systems: The Need for Sentience,Deal B.,Journal of Urban Technology,10.1080/10630732.2017.1285018,54,False,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,"Developing resilience in built human environments is a complex undertaking. It requires decision support tools that can convey complexities in meaningful and understandable ways. Building smart cities and generating big data, however, is not enough. In order to improve decision-making and ultimately inform resilient communities we need to be able to translate big data at scales and in ways that are useful and approachable. In this paper we argue that creating more resilient communities calls for planning support systems (PSSs) that go beyond the ones we have today. We call for PSSs that possess a greater degree of sentience—that (a) possess a greater awareness of application context and user needs; (b) are capable of iterative learning; (c) are capable of spatial and temporal reasoning; (d) understand rules; and (e) are accessible and interactive. We consider the questions: How might intelligent or sentient information delivery systems allow for more strategic, context-aware, resilient, and ultimately sustainable communities?

Seeing chinese cities through big data and statistics,Wu J.,Springer Geography,10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_17,1,False,The George Washington University,"Washington, D.C.",United States,"China has historically been an agricultural nation. China’s urbanization rate was reported to be 18 % in 1978 when it began its economic reforms. It has now become the second largest economy in the world. Urbanization in China increased dramatically in support of this economic growth, tripling to 54 % by the end of 2013. At the same time, many major urban problems also surfaced, including environmental degradation, lack of affordable housing, and traffic congestion. Economic growth will continue to be China’s central policy in the foreseeable future. Chinese cities are seriously challenged to support continuing economic growth with a high quality of life for their residents, while addressing the existing big city diseases. The term “Smart City” began to appear globally around 2008. Embracing the concept allows China to downscale its previous national approach to a more manageable city level. By the end of 2013, China has designated at least 193 locations to be smart city test sites; a national urbanization plan followed in March 2014. The direction of urban development and major challenges are identified in this paper. Some of them are global in nature, and some unique to China. The nation will undoubtedly continue to build their smarter cities in the coming years. The first integrated public information service platform was implemented for several test sites in 2013. It provides a one-stop center for millions of card-carrying residents to use a secure smart card to perform previously separate city functions and consolidate data collection. The pioneering system is real work in progress and helps to lay the foundation for building urban informatics in China.

How should urban planners be trained to handle big data?,French S.P.,Springer Geography,10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_12,21,False,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"Historically urban planners have been educated and trained to work in a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10–21, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101–104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17–33, 1995).

Big data and urban informatics: Innovations and challenges to urban planning and knowledge discovery,Thakuriah P.(.,Springer Geography,10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_2,97,False,University of Glasgow,Glasgow,United Kingdom,"Big Data is the term being used to describe a wide spectrum of observational or “naturally-occurring” data generated through transactional, operational, planning and social activities that are not specifically designed for research. Due to the structure and access conditions associated with such data, their use for research and analysis becomes significantly complicated. New sources of Big Data are rapidly emerging as a result of technological, institutional, social, and business innovations. The objective of this background paper is to describe emerging sources of Big Data, their use in urban research, and the challenges that arise with their use. To a certain extent, Big Data in the urban context has become narrowly associated with sensor (e.g., Internet of Things) or socially generated (e.g., social media or citizen science) data. However, there are many other sources of observational data that are meaningful to different groups of urban researchers and user communities. Examples include privately held transactions data, confidential administrative micro-data, data from arts and humanities collections, and hybrid data consisting of synthetic or linked data. The emerging area of Urban Informatics focuses on the exploration and understanding of urban systems by leveraging novel sources of data. The major potential of Urban Informatics research and applications is in four areas: (1) improved strategies for dynamic urban resource management, (2) theoretical insights and knowledge discovery of urban patterns and processes, (3) strategies for urban engagement and civic participation, and (4) innovations in urban management, and planning and policy analysis. Urban Informatics utilizes Big Data in innovative ways by retrofitting or repurposing existing urban models and simulations that are underpinned by a wide range of theoretical traditions, as well as through data-driven modeling approaches that are largely theory agnostic, although these divergent research approaches are starting to converge in some ways. The paper surveys the kinds of urban problems being considered by going from a data-poor environment to a data-rich world and the ways in which such enquiries have the potential to enhance our understanding, not only of urban systems and processes overall, but also contextual peculiarities and local experiences. The paper concludes by commenting on challenges that are likely to arise in varying degrees when using Big Data for Urban Informatics: technological, methodological, theoretical/epistemological, and the emerging political economy of Big Data.","['describe', 'become', 'simulations', 'patterns', 'models', 'management', 'social', 'new', 'systems', 'existing', 'starting', 'use', 'converge', 'humanities', 'retrofitting', 'result', 'technological', 'structure', 'traditions', 'theoretical', 'well', 'varying', 'informatics', 'associated', 'theoreticalepistemological', 'transactions', 'datapoor', 'complicated', 'narrowly', 'datadriven', 'conditions', 'things', 'considered', 'microdata', 'institutional', 'likely', 'insights', 'eg', 'kinds', 'innovative', 'range', 'administrative', 'communities', 'modeling', 'datarich', 'wide', 'problems', 'divergent', 'meaningful', 'four', 'enhance', 'examples', 'dynamic', 'major', 'experiences', 'due', 'specifically', 'processes', 'concludes', 'exploration', 'rapidly', 'confidential', 'leveraging', 'citizen', 'socially', 'novel', 'areas', 'world', 'commenting', 'include', 'access', 'challenges', 'hybrid', 'user', 'collections', 'contextual', 'operational', 'approaches', 'generated', 'internet', 'engagement', 'ways', 'going', 'enquiries', 'synthetic', 'political', 'strategies', 'local', 'extent', 'spectrum', 'privately', 'significantly', 'media', 'peculiarities', 'agnostic', 'emerging', 'surveys', 'methodological', 'activities', 'overall', 'science', 'sensor', 'designed', 'repurposing', 'arise', 'innovations', 'context', 'certain', 'background', 'arts', 'policy', 'groups', 'resource', 'underpinned', 'term', 'applications', 'potential', 'area', 'largely', 'business', 'linked', 'economy', 'objective', 'utilizes', 'transactional', 'observational', 'researchers', 'different', 'held', 'although', 'sources', 'improved', 'participation', 'focuses', 'becomes', 'consisting', 'discovery', 'degrees', 'environment', 'civic', 'naturallyoccurring', 'many']",2017,"[(3, 0.9987643)]"

Does activity fulfil aspiration? a contextual comparison of smart city applications in practice,de Wijs L.,Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography,10.1007/978-3-319-57819-4_27,1,False,Universiteit van Amsterdam,Amsterdam,Netherlands,"Research on smart city projects and applications has been increasing in recent years (Meijer and Bolivar 2015). The smart city concept is mostly considered from a technology-oriented perspective that stresses the use of data technologies, big data and ICT to ‘smarten up’ cities. In contrast, attention to soft aspects of the smart city—namely smart governance, people and social learning—seems to be limited in both academia and practice. Moreover, what seems to be largely missing from the literature is empirical insight into the extent to which different smart city aspects are factually known of and applied in different geographical contexts. This contribution presents a contextual comparison of smart city applications based on a mainly quantitative empirical analysis. Particular emphasis is put on the knowledge that government practitioners in the Netherlands have of smart aspects and the extent to which they are willing and able to implement smart aspects in their specific local and regional contexts. The results of the analysis show that both in the Netherlands and worldwide there are great aspirations to develop and implement smart city applications, but that to some extent factual activities are lagging behind. The reasons for this are mostly related to a lack of awareness of the possibilities and a lack of financial and political priority. This especially applies to smaller cities in the Netherlands. When this is resolved, actual activities are more likely to live up to the great aspirations regarding the smart city concept.","['social', 'use', 'applied', 'technologyoriented', 'known', 'geographical', 'literature', 'limited', 'bolivar', 'reasons', 'regarding', 'smart', 'considered', 'cities', 'contribution', 'likely', 'recent', 'lagging', 'presents', 'netherlands', 'practitioners', 'quantitative', 'willing', 'comparison', 'implement', 'aspects', 'learningseems', 'applies', 'actual', 'citynamely', 'empirical', 'put', 'resolved', 'worldwide', 'possibilities', 'years', 'show', 'contextual', 'financial', 'perspective', 'great', 'academia', 'related', 'mainly', 'technologies', 'political', 'awareness', 'contrast', 'contexts', 'local', 'smarten', 'extent', 'specific', 'practice', 'people', 'activities', 'increasing', 'lack', 'particular', 'smaller', 'meijer', 'aspirations', 'develop', 'government', 'city', 'governance', 'stresses', 'attention', 'applications', 'largely', 'insight', 'behind', 'ict', 'seems', 'concept', 'live', 'factual', 'factually', 'soft', 'projects', 'mostly', 'different', 'able', 'missing', 'moreover', 'emphasis', 'regional', 'especially', 'priority']",2017,"[(1, 0.67989844), (3, 0.3191495)]"

We determined that the area with the higher possibility of gentrification was that within 600 m of the park. Big data accumulated over the past decade were used to prepare a proactive, systematic procedure to address gentrification, which is materialising in diverse forms.

Understanding the representativeness of mobile phone location data in characterizing human mobility indicators,Lu S.,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,10.3390/ijgi6010007,39,True,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"The advent of big data has aided understanding of the driving forces of human mobility, which is beneficial for many fields, such as mobility prediction, urban planning, and traffic management. However, the data sources used in many studies, such as mobile phone location and geo-tagged social media data, are sparsely sampled in the temporal scale. An individual's records can be distributed over a few hours a day, or a week, or over just a few hours a month. Thus, the representativeness of sparse mobile phone location data in characterizing human mobility requires analysis before using data to derive human mobility patterns. This paper investigates this important issue through an approach that uses subscriber mobile phone location data collected by a major carrier in Shenzhen, China. A dataset of over 5 million mobile phone subscribers that covers 24 h a day is used as a benchmark to test the representativeness of mobile phone location data on human mobility indicators, such as total travel distance, movement entropy, and radius of gyration. This study divides this dataset by hour, using 2- to 23-h segments to evaluate the representativeness due to the availability of mobile phone location data. The results show that different numbers of hourly segments affect estimations of human mobility indicators and can cause overestimations or underestimations from the individual perspective. On average, the total travel distance and movement entropy tend to be underestimated. The underestimation coefficient results for estimation of total travel distance are approximately linear, declining as the number of time segments increases, and the underestimation coefficient results for estimating movement entropy decline logarithmically as the time segments increase, whereas the radius of gyration tends to be more ambiguous due to the loss of isolated locations. This paper suggests that researchers should carefully interpret results derived from this type of sparse data in the era of big data.","['patterns', 'management', 'social', 'number', 'increases', 'tends', 'ambiguous', 'geotagged', 'advent', 'human', 'movement', 'million', 'segments', 'time', 'estimating', 'logarithmically', 'hours', 'whereas', 'scale', 'sparse', 'traffic', 'interpret', 'numbers', 'estimations', 'suggests', 'day', 'linear', 'benchmark', 'radius', 'temporal', 'location', 'month', 'driving', 'collected', 'sparsely', 'dataset', 'distributed', 'major', 'due', 'individuals', 'requires', 'underestimations', 'availability', 'average', 'test', 'declining', 'overestimations', 'estimation', 'show', 'gyration', 'perspective', 'decline', 'loss', 'type', 'subscribers', 'records', 'important', 'beneficial', 'h', 'studies', 'indicators', 'entropy', 'affect', 'week', 'hour', 'subscriber', 'increase', 'media', 'travel', 'era', 'sampled', 'shenzhen', 'isolated', 'total', 'characterizing', 'aided', 'underestimation', 'individual', 'underestimated', 'divides', 'uses', 'prediction', 'mobile', 'phone', 'representativeness', 'locations', 'mobility', 'fields', 'issue', 'tend', 'approximately', 'hourly', 'derive', 'evaluate', 'researchers', 'different', 'investigates', 'covers', 'thus', 'coefficient', 'sources', 'distance', 'carefully', 'carrier', 'cause', 'forces', 'derived', 'many']",2017,"[(1, 0.7139029), (3, 0.28531194)]"

Understanding the social, economic, and cultural dynamics of urban life requires both an appreciation of the social sciences and a substantive engagement with communities across neighborhoods. The “Smart City” messaging is replete with claims of the potential for sensors and information and communication technologies (ICT) to re-shape urban life, although such rhetoric ignores the practical realities and constraints of urban decision-making and the social and distributional concerns of policy outcomes. Rather, significant progress could be achieved at the neighborhood scale by focusing diverse, intensive, and persistent real-time data collection and analysis on a “Quantified Community” (QC). The QC—a long-term neighborhood informatics research initiative—is a network of instrumented urban neighborhoods that collect, measure, and analyze data on physical and environmental conditions and human behavior to provide a rich resource to better understand how neighborhoods and the built environment affect individual and social well-being. The resulting unique experimental environment provides a testing ground for new physical and informatics technologies, policies, and behavioral interventions, allowing for unprecedented studies in urban planning and design, urban systems engineering and management, and the social sciences. Focusing on the neighborhood scale also allows for meaningful interaction with, and participation by, the people who live, work, and play in that space and shifts the emphasis of data-driven design away from top-down routinization to a human-centric problem-solving.

As a proof of concept, this essay presents a case study of Zurich that successfully implemented previous research achievements in the real environment. It established that urban travel behaviour can, in fact, be collected by sensors embedded in mobile devices, and that the data thus obtained can be used to measure the characteristics of trip behaviour in cities by means of an advanced classifying algorithm and analysis. The strength of this research is its pioneering role in clearing the ground for future urban data collection methods and planning strategies. Specifically, this study could provide answers to the following key questions: How can crowdsourcing be applied to the collection of urban transportation data? What kinds of information can be extracted from the crowdsourced mobile sensing platform? What kinds of knowledge, within the transportation domain, can be derived from the above?.","['mining', 'case', 'applied', 'method', 'answers', 'deliver', 'crowdsourcingbased', 'questions', 'sought', 'pioneering', 'zurich', 'cities', 'following', 'fact', 'kinds', 'role', 'presents', 'idea', 'location', 'highlevel', 'collected', 'sensors', 'devices', 'technology', 'provide', 'specifically', 'strength', 'could', 'accurate', 'find', 'measure', 'collection', 'achievements', 'means', 'previously', 'successfully', 'sensing', 'previous', 'domain', 'acceleration', 'obtained', 'power', 'strategies', 'advanced', 'ground', 'key', 'transportation', 'main', 'established', 'useful', 'proof', 'obtain', 'within', 'travel', 'crowdsourcing', 'activities', 'clearing', 'behaviour', 'conducted', 'platform', 'deeper', 'indepth', 'mobile', 'extracted', 'essay', 'concept', 'live', 'characteristics', 'saving', 'trip', 'implemented', 'crowdsourced', 'algorithm', 'real', 'embedded', 'efficient', 'integrating', 'future', 'thus', 'classifying', 'environment', 'derived', 'smartphones']",2016,"[(1, 0.869608), (3, 0.12937161)]"

Making a smart city for the smart grid? The urban material politics of actualising smart electricity networks,Bulkeley H.,Environment and Planning A,10.1177/0308518X16648152,103,False,Durham University,Durham,United Kingdom,"In a growing debate about the smart city, considerations of the ways in which urban infrastructures and their materialities are being reconfigured and contested remain in the shadows of analyses which have been primarily concerned with the management and flow of digitalisation and big data in pursuit of new logics for economic growth. In this paper, we examine the ways in which the ‘smart city’ is being put to work for different ends and through different means. We argue that the co-constitution of the urban as a site for carbon governance and a place where smart energy systems are developed is leading to novel forms of governmental intervention operating at the conjunction of the grid and the city. We seek to move beyond examining the rationales and discourses of such interventions to engage with the ways in which they are actualised in and through particular urban conditions in order to draw attention to their material politics. In so doing, we argue that the urban is not a mere backdrop to transitions in electricity provision and use but central to its politics, while electricity is also critical to the ways in which we should understand the politics of urbanism.","['coconstitution', 'governance', 'remain', 'provision', 'management', 'developed', 'new', 'examining', 'systems', 'intervention', 'electricity', 'growth', 'attention', 'examine', 'backdrop', 'use', 'argue', 'ways', 'operating', 'leading', 'flow', 'draw', 'material', 'infrastructures', 'growing', 'ends', 'politics', 'order', 'engage', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'economic', 'rationales', 'critical', 'shadows', 'understand', 'analyses', 'central', 'seek', 'different', 'governmental', 'smart', 'conditions', 'digitalisation', 'contested', 'move', 'beyond', 'forms', 'novel', 'reconfigured', 'interventions', 'carbon', 'actualised', 'pursuit', 'put', 'materialities', 'transitions', 'mere', 'discourses', 'site', 'grid', 'particular', 'energy', 'considerations', 'logics', 'means', 'place', 'conjunction', 'urbanism', 'debate', 'work', 'city']",2016,"[(3, 0.997566)]"
Why Don't Housing Choice Voucher Recipients Live Near Better Schools? Insights from Big Data,Ellen I.G.,Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,10.1002/pam.21929,27,False,Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service,New York,United States,"Housing choice vouchers provide low-income households with additional income to spend on rental housing in the private market. The assistance vouchers provide is substantial, offering the potential to dramatically expand the neighborhoods—and associated public schools—that low-income households can reach. However, existing research on the program suggests that housing choice voucher holders live in neighborhoods with schools that are no better than those accessible to other households with similar incomes. Households, in other words, do not seem to spend the additional income provided by the voucher to access better schools. In this analysis we rely on a large-scale administrative data set to explore why voucher households typically do not live near to better schools, as measured by school-level proficiency rates. We combine confidential administrative data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on 1.4 million housing choice voucher holders in 15 states, with school-level data from 5,841 different school districts, to examine why the average housing voucher holder does not live near to higher-performing schools than otherwise similar households without vouchers. Specifically, we use the large-scale administrative data set to test whether voucher holders living in areas with good schools nearby and slack housing markets move toward better schools when schools become salient for them—that is, when their oldest child becomes school eligible. We take advantage of the thick sample of households with young children provided through our administrative data to implement both a household fixed effects and a regression discontinuity design. Together these analyses shed light on whether voucher households are more likely to move toward better schools when schools are most relevant, and how market conditions shape that response. We find that families with vouchers are more likely to move toward a better school in the year before their oldest child meets the eligibility cutoff for kindergarten, suggesting salience matters. Further, the magnitude of the effect is larger in metropolitan areas with a relatively high share of affordable rental units located near high-performing schools and in neighborhoods in close proximity to higher-performing schools. Results suggest that, if given the appropriate information and opportunities, more voucher families would move to better schools when their children reach school age.","['households', 'become', 'families', 'existing', 'use', 'kindergarten', 'meets', 'high', 'nearby', 'dramatically', 'voucher', 'holder', 'set', 'million', 'eligible', 'associated', 'states', 'would', 'analyses', 'lowincome', 'together', 'suggests', 'household', 'relevant', 'conditions', 'move', 'neighborhoods', 'schools', 'likely', 'schoollevel', 'similar', 'located', 'suggest', 'highperforming', 'neighborhoodsand', 'holders', 'administrative', 'expand', 'incomes', 'implement', 'whether', 'spend', 'provide', 'specifically', 'program', 'thick', 'typically', 'choice', 'cutoff', 'confidential', 'toward', 'find', 'areas', 'suggesting', 'housing', 'access', 'take', 'discontinuity', 'average', 'better', 'test', 'oldest', 'matters', 'largescale', 'measured', 'private', 'public', 'fixed', 'shed', 'regression', 'higherperforming', 'magnitude', 'seem', 'markets', 'vouchers', 'metropolitan', 'themthat', 'rates', 'reach', 'accessible', 'year', 'provided', 'light', 'children', 'affordable', 'advantage', 'substantial', 'good', 'close', 'age', 'living', 'effects', 'sample', 'proficiency', 'slack', 'otherwise', 'assistance', 'young', 'given', 'larger', 'department', 'examine', 'income', 'potential', 'relatively', 'explore', 'live', 'offering', 'near', 'proximity', 'market', 'without', 'schoolsthat', 'additional', 'words', 'child', 'share', 'appropriate', 'combine', 'different', 'effect', 'school', 'salience', 'salient', 'districts', 'eligibility', 'shape', 'rely', 'becomes', 'rental', 'response', 'units', 'opportunities']",2016,"[(3, 0.99868023)]"

This paper argues that integrating data from these with new sources of urban data can allow for deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between individuals, environments and healthy places.

Wise cities: 'Old' big data and 'slow' real time,Carrera F.,Built Environment,10.2148/benv.42.3.474,7,False,,,,"'Big Data' typically refers to large datasets, mined in bulk from modern electronic devices, that can be analyzed to extract patterns of behaviour at both the macro and micro level. More often than not, big data is derived from major systems such as social networks or telephone providers, or from other sensor networks that compose the big data firehose. Humans have also been recruited to act as sentient sensors who can contribute richer and finer-grained crowdsourced data to this big pile. Nevertheless, big data is not simply found in the form of (near) real-time information extracted through reality mining. While the activities that take place in a city are fast and mobile, the immobile structures that make up the physical city evolve at a much slower pace, creating a sedimentary layer of 'old big data' that is possibly more useful, certainly as useful for city planning as the information derived from realtime sensing. Using our efforts in Venice (Italy) to record the historical evolution and current state of the city through many kinds of data, we show here how smartcity approaches can be used to capture the backlog of data that predate the current age of the internet, and also to intercept gradual structural changes to the built environment that happen in 'slow real time'.

A three-step spatial-temporal-semantic clustering method for human activity pattern analysis,Huang W.,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B2-549-2016,6,True,Toronto Metropolitan University,Toronto,Canada,"How people move in cities and what they do in various locations at different times form human activity patterns. Human activity pattern plays a key role in in urban planning, traffic forecasting, public health and safety, emergency response, friend recommendation, and so on. Therefore, scholars from different fields, such as social science, geography, transportation, physics and computer science, have made great efforts in modelling and analysing human activity patterns or human mobility patterns. One of the essential tasks in such studies is to find the locations or places where individuals stay to perform some kind of activities before further activity pattern analysis. In the era of Big Data, the emerging of social media along with wearable devices enables human activity data to be collected more easily and efficiently. Furthermore, the dimension of the accessible human activity data has been extended from two to three (space or space-time) to four dimensions (space, time and semantics). More specifically, not only a location and time that people stay and spend are collected, but also what people ""say"" for in a location at a time can be obtained. The characteristics of these datasets shed new light on the analysis of human mobility, where some of new methodologies should be accordingly developed to handle them. Traditional methods such as neural networks, statistics and clustering have been applied to study human activity patterns using geosocial media data. Among them, clustering methods have been widely used to analyse spatiotemporal patterns. However, to our best knowledge, few of clustering algorithms are specifically developed for handling the datasets that contain spatial, temporal and semantic aspects all together. In this work, we propose a three-step human activity clustering method based on space, time and semantics to fill this gap. One-year Twitter data, posted in Toronto, Canada, is used to test the clustering-based method.

The geographically weighted regression (GWR) is implemented to model the spatial heterogeneity of the taxi ridership and visualize the spatial distributions of parameter estimations. The results suggest that the GWR model outperforms the ordinary least square model in both goodness of model fit and explanatory accuracy. The urban form is revealed to have significant impact on urban taxi ridership and strong spatial variability for parameter estimations is observed.

The findings on residents' travel behaviors could help the government make the appropriate urban planning and help residents make the better daily travel planning.","['patterns', 'twodimensional', 'collected', 'behavior', 'mobile', 'population', 'characterizes', 'method', 'records', 'storage', 'feature', 'demand', 'phone', 'help', 'human', 'structure', 'analyzed', 'related', 'four', 'bring', 'reveals', 'studies', 'flow', 'movement', 'dynamic', 'graph', 'discussed', 'density', 'resident', 'od', 'map', 'distribution', 'local', 'continuous', 'visualization', 'acquisition', 'could', 'field', 'appropriate', 'residents', 'fast', 'behaviors', 'capabilities', 'travel', 'objectives', 'shanghai', 'particularly', 'particle', 'characterize', 'demonstrates', 'make', 'animation', 'challenges', 'better', 'depicts', 'vector', 'daily', 'government', 'millions', 'techniques', 'smooth', 'opportunities']",2015,"[(1, 0.9977704)]"
Implementing smart urban metabolism in the Stockholm Royal Seaport: Smart city SRS,Shahrokni H.,Journal of Industrial Ecology,10.1111/jiec.12308,102,False,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Stockholm,Sweden,"For half a century, system scientists have relied on urban metabolism (UM) as a pragmatic framework to support the needed transition toward sustainable urban development. It has been suggested that information and communication technology (ICT) and, more specifically, smart cities can be leveraged in this transition. Given the recent advances in smart cities, smart urban metabolism (SUM) is considered a technology-enabled evolution of the UM framework, overcoming some of its current limitations. Most significantly, the SUM framework works at high temporal (up to real-time) and spatial (down to household/individual) resolutions. This article presents the first implementation of SUM in the Smart City Stockholm Royal Seaport R&D project; it further analyzes barriers and discusses the potential long-term implications of the findings. Four key performance indicators (KPIs) are generated in real time based on the integration of heterogeneous, real-time data sources. These are kilowatt-hours per square meter, carbon dioxide equivalents per capita, kilowatt-hours of primary energy per capita, and share of renewables percentage. These KPIs are fed back on three levels (household, building, and district) on four interfaces, developed for different audiences. The most challenging barrier identified was accessing and integrating siloed data from the different data owners (utilities, building owners, and so forth). It is hard to overcome unless a significant value is perceived. A number of long-term opportunities were described in the SUM context; among those, it is envisioned that SUM could enable a new understanding of the causalities that govern urbanism and allow citizens and city officials to receive feedback on the system consequences of their choices.","['metabolism', 'developed', 'new', 'number', 'described', 'audiences', 'evolution', 'heterogeneous', 'high', 'district', 'allow', 'integration', 'hard', 'time', 'transition', 'implications', 'works', 'household', 'smart', 'considered', 'cities', 'siloed', 'sum', 'needed', 'seaport', 'dioxide', 'recent', 'owners', 'longterm', 'back', 'envisioned', 'urbanism', 'stockholm', 'presents', 'temporal', 'square', 'levels', 'barriers', 'sustainable', 'kilowatthours', 'overcoming', 'realtime', 'three', 'significant', 'discusses', 'capita', 'four', 'technology', 'forth', 'citizens', 'per', 'specifically', 'limitations', 'choices', 'renewables', 'kpis', 'could', 'pragmatic', 'toward', 'advances', 'half', 'consequences', 'govern', 'implementation', 'fed', 'meter', 'enable', 'perceived', 'value', 'householdindividual', 'um', 'generated', 'royal', 'interfaces', 'indicators', 'relied', 'barrier', 'scientists', 'percentage', 'key', 'feedback', 'communication', 'leveraged', 'significantly', 'utilities', 'overcome', 'receive', 'unless', 'primary', 'resolutions', 'energy', 'identified', 'context', 'project', 'city', 'challenging', 'given', 'potential', 'suggested', 'ict', 'officials', 'causalities', 'technologyenabled', 'first', 'building', 'share', 'real', 'accessing', 'different', 'support', 'current', 'carbon', 'integrating', 'system', 'sources', 'among', 'analyzes', 'century', 'rd', 'equivalents', 'opportunities']",2015,"[(3, 0.9985499)]"
"Towards a comparative science of cities: Using mobile traffic records in New York, London, and Hong Kong",Grauwin S.,Computational Approaches for Urban Environments,10.1007/978-3-319-11469-9_15,87,False,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"This chapter examines the possibility to analyze and compare human activities in an urban environment based on the detection of mobile phone usage patterns. Thanks to an unprecedented collection of counter data recording the number of calls, SMS, and data transfers resolved both in time and space, we confirm the connection between temporal activity profile and land usage in three global cities: New York, London, and Hong Kong. By comparing whole cities’ typical patterns, we provide insights on how cultural, technological, and economical factors shape human dynamics. At a more local scale, we use clustering analysis to identify locations with similar patterns within a city. Our research reveals a universal structure of cities, with core financial centers all sharing similar activity patterns and commercial or residential areas with more city-specific patterns. These findings hint that as the economy becomes more global, common patterns emerge in business areas of different cities across the globe, while the impact of local conditions still remains recognizable on the level of routine people activity.","['hint', 'patterns', 'new', 'number', 'common', 'use', 'emerge', 'technological', 'analyze', 'human', 'structure', 'time', 'economical', 'global', 'scale', 'compare', 'york', 'conditions', 'cities', 'hong', 'insights', 'clustering', 'similar', 'core', 'possibility', 'temporal', 'kong', 'examines', 'across', 'sharing', 'confirm', 'three', 'globe', 'transfers', 'detection', 'provide', 'counter', 'recording', 'usage', 'space', 'profile', 'areas', 'thanks', 'residential', 'resolved', 'collection', 'whole', 'routine', 'financial', 'london', 'comparing', 'recognizable', 'connection', 'typical', 'remains', 'reveals', 'factors', 'local', 'chapter', 'within', 'still', 'people', 'activities', 'land', 'commercial', 'dynamics', 'city', 'sms', 'mobile', 'phone', 'locations', 'universal', 'business', 'calls', 'cityspecific', 'economy', 'centers', 'identify', 'different', 'cultural', 'shape', 'becomes', 'environment', 'activity', 'level', 'unprecedented']",2015,"[(0, 0.57484597), (1, 0.42396358)]"

Knowledge-mining the Australian smart grid smart city data: A statistical-neural approach to demand-response analysis,Motlagh O.,Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography,10.1007/978-3-319-18368-8_10,22,False,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation,Canberra,Australia,"Large scale field trials of smart grid technologies provide important insights as they capture the complex interdependencies of all the key variables, including consumer behaviours, which are needed for their effective evaluation. We present the Australian Smart Grid Smart City program and describe its big data using a narrative approach to hasten understanding and further analyses by others. Then we present a novel statistical-neural approach to maximise knowledge extraction from large datasets of diurnal load profiles, and demonstrate its use in evaluating the effectiveness of two cost-reflective product offerings, a Network-type and a Retail-type product bundle. The methods of analyses include Principal Component Analysis and Self-Organising Mapping. The results for the mid-winter electricity consumption profiles of participating households in July 2013 in New South Wales showed consumption behaviour changes with up to 12% reduction in relative peak demand at 700 households who accepted the offerings compared to the control group. The resultant load factor of the high consuming outliers improved by about 18% under demand-response compared to the control group.

Validation of spatial decay law caused by urban commercial center's mutual attraction in polycentric city: Spatio-temporal data mining of floating cars' GPS data in Shenzhen,Zhou S.,Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica,10.11821/dlxb201412007,28,False,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"Urban multi-center phenomenon is very common in many countries, which challenges urban models with the assumption of single center. Although there are literatures trying to explain the mechanism of multi-center urban system using models based on multicenter, the lack of empirical research makes the models being questioned. Under the pattern of multi-center, does the traditional classical geographic model like law of distance decay exist? What factors will disturb the model? This study aims to analyze and validate the spatiotemporal discipline of attration and mutual relationship between two commercial centers, based on spatio-temporal data mining of floating cars' GPS data and the recognition of two important commercial centers in Shenzhen City, China. The study reveals that the attraction between two commercial centers shows distinct power function relationship, which validates the law of geographic spatial decay. At the same time, the spatial decay's law shows some local disturbances due to a series of causes, such as the mutual attraction from other important and crowded areas, the influence of infrastructure to accessibility, urban spatial layout factor like landform and humanity factors like consumer behavior and preference etc.","['models', 'mining', 'common', 'relationship', 'analyze', 'aims', 'time', 'distinct', 'trying', 'makes', 'classical', 'traditional', 'two', 'disturbances', 'series', 'landform', 'phenomenon', 'literatures', 'due', 'mutual', 'accessibility', 'shows', 'empirical', 'factor', 'validate', 'areas', 'law', 'attration', 'etc', 'challenges', 'crowded', 'layout', 'cars', 'behavior', 'important', 'reveals', 'power', 'factors', 'local', 'humanity', 'center', 'function', 'assumption', 'multicenter', 'geographic', 'decay', 'shenzhen', 'lack', 'validates', 'commercial', 'like', 'infrastructure', 'influence', 'city', 'countries', 'decays', 'single', 'gps', 'preference', 'recognition', 'exist', 'attraction', 'explain', 'disturb', 'centers', 'pattern', 'spatiotemporal', 'discipline', 'consumer', 'mechanism', 'although', 'system', 'distance', 'causes', 'many', 'questioned', 'floating']",2014,"[(1, 0.5443453), (3, 0.45455468)]"
Detecting the dynamics of urban structure through spatial network analysis,Zhong C.,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,10.1080/13658816.2014.914521,398,False,ETH Zürich,Zurich,Switzerland,"Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a ‘big’ data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation. In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population’s activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city’s master plan. To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban transformations.","['community', 'movements', 'new', 'number', 'existing', 'large', 'use', 'emerge', 'human', 'wider', 'structure', 'borders', 'set', 'movement', 'essential', 'periods', 'roles', 'graph', 'view', 'engage', 'time', 'phenomena', 'geographical', 'line', 'monitored', 'hotspots', 'smart', 'revealed', 'cities', 'finally', 'prominent', 'form', 'neighborhoods', 'insights', 'recent', 'amounts', 'changing', 'possibility', 'fare', 'two', 'back', 'elements', 'automatic', 'series', 'quantitative', 'generalization', 'even', 'administrative', 'interactions', 'communities', 'essence', 'properties', 'complex', 'disposable', 'demand', 'apply', 'made', 'towards', 'becoming', 'weight', 'network', 'rapidly', 'onto', 'find', 'edges', 'coalesce', 'shows', 'space', 'areas', 'clear', 'grow', 'collection', 'enable', 'developing', 'denote', 'detecting', 'c', 'projected', 'trips', 'show', 'years', 'visible', 'comparing', 'generated', 'clusters', 'records', 'important', 'explicitly', 'card', 'construct', 'b', 'ones', 'local', 'transportation', 'available', 'uncovering', 'polycentric', 'singapore', 'socioeconomic', 'represents', 'lifestyles', 'obtain', 'travel', 'emerging', 'citys', 'weighted', 'overall', 'science', 'increasing', 'populations', 'denotes', 'smaller', 'effects', 'sample', 'daily', 'summarize', 'city', 'node', 'efficiently', 'transformations', 'income', 'ever', 'influences', 'centralities', 'area', 'largely', 'hubs', 'size', 'short', 'live', 'plan', 'volume', 'first', 'master', 'centers', 'subdivision', 'identify', 'different', 'diverse', 'identifies', 'subcenters', 'sea', 'structures', 'system', 'defined', 'yields', 'make', 'separate', 'trends', 'reveal', 'activity', 'ongoing', 'directed']",2014,"[(1, 0.7661096), (3, 0.23333615)]"
